0|0|"For years I roasted my own beans and the only reason I don't do it much lately is because I just don't ever have the time. So you end up too often roasting a batch of beans at 6 am so you can have a morning cup. Which means you're grinding and perking warm beans which is not optimal.So too much of a hassle and while I still do the occasional batch to my own particular taste, I have shopped around for a reliable substitute.The first thing I discovered is that you can pay a lot of money for some really mediocre to lousy beans. But I eventually managed tofind some primo stuff and this is one I highly recommend.I'm not going to give you all that ""floral notes and finish of absinthe"" nonsense.  It's just good coffee, dark and rich and never bitter. These guys do a good job and you ought to give it a try. Maybe you'll like it and maybe it won't be exactly what you're looking for but either way you won't feel like you paid a premium price for a bag of mud,"|1
1|1|"After all these years, still the best coffee you can get.  Keep in mind that even the book about the history of Starbucks has a mention of how they wanted to model their product after Peet's... and Peet's just cares so much about flavor, roasting, complexity, etc., etc. that you can't go wrong.  You might say ""welllllll, my local coffee house does an amazing job"", but you know what, most local coffee roasters still don't have the expertise or the equipment, or the scientists and artists behind Peet's coffee... even Starbucks supposedly over-roasts their beans for consistency, and Starbucks is a little too speedy and anxiety causing for me.  Peet's is to Coffee what a great vintner is to wine... they're true connoisseurs.  Enjoy!  Also, as a suggestion, just keep shopping and shopping and shopping and eventually you'll see some great deals on here..."|1
2|2|This is a good, strong coffee. It's not the original Major Dickason's Blend that put Peet's on the map in the late 1980's though. Back then the beans were quite rich and a real treat. As with any coffee bean over the years, crops change, so beans are not quite the same. I have found this to be true when ordering any of my favorites directly from Peet's over the past few years or via Amazon.I wouldn't call the newest incarnation of this blend bitter, but it is a tiny bit acidic. To balance the acidity, I usually put 2 scoops of Peet's French Roast in for a fuller body and smoothness. For me. that's the perfect cup as I love full-bodied, strong, but low acidity coffees that have a richness to them.I have read the reviews about receiving a stale bag after receiving one for the first time last week (use by date was only 6 days away and roast date was in the Fall of 2017). I would advise anyone going through Prime to just chat with them about this instead of negative comments. They have wonderful customer service reps who will take care of the matter. It would be a shame if this is the first time you tried the Major Dickason's Blend and didn't enjoy a fresh, robust cup. While not my favorite Peet's blend due to the acidity of late, it's still really good compared to other bagged coffees. If you like a weaker cup, just reduce by one scoop. It doesn't get watery, just a bit less in your face.|1
3|3|"At times, making a good espresso seems to be a fleeting event. I do find with Peet’s Major Dickason’s whole coffee beans, my results are more reliable and consistent.While I drink several other beans and constantly try others, Peet's Major Dickason's Whole Beans are my go to coffee several days a week.I am a dedicated espresso drinker, but it has taken me years to make a good espresso at home. Saying ""good"" however, is a matter of opinion. I have had good espressos at some cafes and restaurants, but most of the time, I am disappointed, and yet these places have loyal customers, who buy the same espresso and enjoy it. For me a good espresso is dependent on three things:1. The quality of the beans2. The equipment3. The techniqueStarting with a simple screw on cover espresso machine, I have upgraded a couple of times over twenty years. I started with the standard Krups electric spice and bean grinder and while the grind was not consistent, I did not know anything else. I still have that grinder, and now, I only use it for spices.For me, a burr grinder was a turning point, but I never thought I would own one. After reading a couple Kindle e-books and scouring the web, I became obsessed with improving my technique, and to my surprise, my wife gave me a Rancillio burr grinder. (Great wife!).Along the way, I discovered Peet’s Major Dickason’s whole beans and then found it on Amazon for a great price, with Prime Shipping. It has become a solid performer for me, and while I go through periods of success and failure with any beans, Peet’s Major Dickason's whole beans are consistent. They give me a smooth cup, when I make it right. I have used many other beans, and have a few other favorites, but Peet’s Major Dickason’s is my day-to-day go to coffee.I made the mistake of ordering the ground coffee (vs. whole beans) a month ago, and could not use it for espresso. I tried using it in my Moka Pot, but the grind was too coarse. I immediately ordered the whole beans, because the price is typically as good I can find it locally, and as a Prime member, I get the beans in two days. Why go to the store, when I can have them quickly delivered to my home?My other performers are Bella Finca (Henry’s House of Coffee, San Francisco) and one of Atomic Coffee Roasters espresso (Beverly, MA). Atomic has two different espresso beans, but I cannot recall the one I like better. Both are sold by GoCoffeeGo on Amazon. GoCoffeeGo has a $5 shipping charge, so those coffees are too expensive for my normal budget. I have enjoyed the Kicking Horse coffees on Amazon: Kick Ass, Grizzly Claw and their 454 Horse Power, in that order. I find, as mentioned by other reviewers, that Kick Ass beans are inconsistent, which is very disappointing. Recently it doesn’t even taste like the same coffee I have had from them for the past eight months, otherwise, I would drink more of it.As to technique, my preference is to keep my beans in a steel vacuumed coffee canister on the counter, measuring out 15.6 grahams of beans, a fine ground (it’s all relative, I grind it to get my targeted pour time and taste), a firm five-point tamping method, preheated cup and saucer, and 25 +/- second pour. I strive for a dark honey colored stream, with plenty of crèma, which I read is the “Holy Grail” of the espresso world. The delectable brew is captured in a little measuring marked shot glass. I do a lot of praying during these moments, I talk nicely to all my equipment and cheer them on. When everything lines up, the result is a perfect cup for me. There are days where I must walk away from my attempts. At times, making a good espresso seems to be a fleeting event. I do find with Peet’s Major Dickason’s whole coffee beans, my results are more reliable and in my world, a good smooth doppio (2 ounces) with a nice crèma, is a wonderful thing."|1
4|4|Disappointed. Received the package 12/20 that was roasted 9/18 and best by 12/17 so past the best by date. Usually when ordering via Amazon things are much fresher. I won't be ordering this product again. Which is a shame because it is quite good. Usually you get a discount for out of date products not a full price tag.|0
5|5|This is a review for the addon listing of Peet's Major Dickerson blend.I've been a Peet's convert for a while now, in fact Peet's ruined my preference for medium roasts with it's Maj D blend and I was quite a coffee snob willing to spend more for quality at other website roasters typically ordering around 7 lbs a month.  But when I discovered Maj D I was surprised at how rich, complex and satisfying of a roast it was.  For a while I ordered from their website but I'd check in with amazon from time to time and saw they had this listing while shopping one day.  Gave it a shot as I'm always a bit cautious about ordering whole beans off of Amazon when its Prime but knowing what the roast to order tasted like I had a good foundation for comparison.  I can happily say its the same and at the price listing (I have no trouble hitting that $25 minimum) its a solid win.  I often shop around trying other roasters/blends, but Peet's is my roaster of choice, they really are for my tastes, the best.|1
6|6|"I don't have enough time to write as many reviews as I did years ago, and via my participation with Amazon's Vine Voice program I get free items in exchange for my unbiased review so it is EXTREMELY infrequently that I write a review just for the reason of ""this product is absolutely the best.""I don't remember the first time I got to experience Peet's Major Dickason, but it was years ago and, ever since, as far as I'm concerned, there's not really a use for any other coffee.The sense of smell is one most closely tied to a strong emotional reaction. Think about the smell of frying bacon, or the smell of a really fine bakery, or a fragrant, blooming rose. Major Dickason's is that kind of smell - it's not just a *good smell.* No, it's a smell that's so good it conjures up in my head the best feelings and emotions. If you haven't had the pleasure you may be wondering ""well.... what does it smell like?""Coffee. It smells like coffee - but it smells like the best coffee imaginable: like God gave you a nose for no reason other than to smell Major Dickason's.It's worth mentioning that it tastes as good as it smells. I constantly have Major Dickason's k-cups around for when I'm pressed for time and I just HAVE to have a cup of coffee. I also constantly have whole beans, which I grind fresh and brew either in the keurig or the ninja - but the truth is Major Dickason's will turn a cheap 10 dollar coffee pot into a barista-inspired heaven that the most expensive coffee-brewing equipment, without Major Dickason's, can't hope to duplicate.Peet's Major Dickason's is one of the ways I know God loves us."|1
7|7|This is the only coffee that should exist. Major Dickason’s Blend is so dark that it sponsors Kylo Ren and The First Order.If you like your coffee to taste like coffee should, buy a couple bags of this every month and buckle up.|1
8|8|I've found Peet's coffee to be the finest & tastiest available at (nearly) any price.  The quality, consistency & flavor are well above average.  This Dickason's Decaf may be the finest cup of unleaded Joe you'll ever have.  I've searched for many years to find the perfect cup (of decaf) and this might just be it.Nothing from Folgers, Gevalia, Seattle's Best, Community, J&B, Starbucks or otherwise, even comes close.  Smooth, ripe coffee flavor with a deeply satisfying dark(ish) roast.  Well rounded & full flavor profile with scarcely any acid.  Has enough character and fortitude to substitute well for espresso, when pressed.  It's seriously satisfying, no-compromise Decaf... and I never thought I'd say that.  Cheers!|1
9|9|UPDATED April 2018: Peet's stop making the decaf house blend over 6 months ago. On February I saw it back here and  I purchased 4 of them thinking that after it was discontinue they brought it back, big mistake, this is nothing like the old decaf house blend, it is bitter and the flavor is very bad. I wasted my money buying these. Not sure why they even call it the same if it is different coffee taste. I trashed all of them.By far one of the best decaf coffees out there. It is better if you purchase it fresh from their store. This one you'll need to grind a little more if using for espresso which I do. My friends can't tell is decaf, I have one friend that always tell me no decaf for me, I only drink real coffee and can tell,  I will  not drink decaf, well, she had been drinking this one every time she comes over and doesn't know. Very sneaky of me but it tells you how much it taste like the real thing. LOL|0
10|10|My favorite decaf coffee and it’s water processed, which is amazing. The first water processed where I don’t notice the coffee tasting “off”If you’ve tried other water processed decaf coffee and thought it tastes different I urge you to try this one. I purchased a few popular water processed decaf coffee’s and didn’t like the taste- I didn’t even realize this was water processed until reading the bag. Love that it’s healthier then the other decaf blends.|1
11|11|Peet's Major Dickason's coffee is hands down my favorite coffee. I used to love French Roast but find Major Dickason's to be a superior blend. It's got a deep, rich, robust flavor that's smooth, complex and satisfying. I also find it to be less acidic than your standard coffee.I use an Aeropress coffee maker (available via Amazon) using 3 Tbsp of freshly ground beans (roughly 15 grams) with 12 ozs of 205°F water for each mug of coffee.The price on Amazon is excellent for this whole bean coffee. I use Subscribe and Save to get this monthly staple and the beans are always taste freshly roasted.|1
12|12|I am not kidding.  I am a coffee nut (aficionado).  I love coffee and have been through the gambit of coffees and this is the best grind I have found short of the $40 a pound gourmet beans.I  have not seen this particular roast before, but it is dark and rich with oils soaking the beans.  When it grinds, the aroma is phenomenal for this grade of coffee.  I have now made regular coffee with it in a french press, espresso and even filled a refillable keurig filter with it, and every cup came out great.  The espresso has a wowza kick to it!!  I have had my espresso machine for a while, and I don't remember getting a kick like this from a cup of espresso in a very long time.The flavor of each is at the very high end of anything you could likely get for under $30 a pound.  It beats out Starbucks Sumatra easily.  It trumps many other brands I have tried, even the allegedly organic beans from Whole Foods.  What is amazing is the after taste.  It lingers, probably because of the oils in the coffee, and the flavor is fresh on the tongue even a few moments after you finish the cup.If you are a cream and sugar person, do not bother with this.  It is not for you.  You will never appreciate the difference.|1
13|13|I have tried literally dozens of coffees out there. I always thought i was a dark coffee person and had a hard time finding a good coffee to fit my palette. This coffee had a very nice rich, velvety and smooth flavor. No acidy bite at all. I cannot find it in any local stores in my area so amazon keep this coffee!!This is my daily coffee now. Great price too!! Try some for yourself!!! A++|1
14|14|Made my usual cold brew with my Toddy, and was recommended to try this by a friend. Typically I'll spend a few extra dollars for some of my favorite dark roast coffee beans, but wanted to see if I could save some money while still having a great cold brew. Unfortunately, I found this to be unusually bitter and strong with my regular 12 hour process. Perhaps this is best left as a hot brewed coffee, as there's just no body or discernible flavor notes to it.|0
15|15|"Over the last 40 plus years, I have made do with  some of the worst coffee imaginable in the military , had some good coffee, but have always been searching for a GREAT coffee.  I've tried everything I could lay my hands on, except for the coffee eaten and then ""recycled"" from the Civet cat. (who thought of that??) I found Starbucks coffee to always have a sort of burned taste, Gevalia to have no ""edge"" at all, etc, etc. Finally, I found Peet's Maj. Dickenson. Not bitter, but not bland. I've been drinking it for about 5 years now, and still stop to savor that first sip of the day. Great body, perfect flavor, what more can you say?"|1
16|16|This coffee has become my hands-down favorite coffee! I used to only drink dark roasts, then found my way to lighter roasts. I would say this is pretty similar to Starbucks Veranda, but totally better. I used to buy Starbucks Veranda, but have been drinking the Colombia Luminosa for a few months now and completely love it. It seems to have a brighter, more complex flavor. Peet's Big Bang is great too, but this is my favorite. I'm pretty disappointed that they are out of stock right now, so my recurring monthly order isn't being shipped. I'm drinking the Big Bang roast that I picked up at my local Kroger, but they were out of Colombia Luminosa too. Bring it back!|1
17|17|"Taking into account its decaf bar none it's the ""Best dang coffee I've ever had"". Peet's Coffee, Decaf French Roast, Dark Roast, Ground Coffee, 12 oz. Bag, Decaffeinated Coffee, Bold, Intense & Complex Dark Roast Blend of Latin American Coffees, with a Smoky Flavor & Bite Decided to get off the caffeine and woe was me. After the week long headache I tried and tried to find a good bold reasonably priced  DECAF coffee. FYI, you  won't find one in your local grocery store. I even went old school and started using a percolator on the stove top. After going through at least Seven (7) brands failing to make the grade I gave Peet's a try. This coffee is so good I cut out using sugar which is great as I inch closer and closer to diabetes as I age (runs in fam). Long story short, if you want a Great Decaf that won't break the bank this is it!!!"|1
18|18|Peet's decaf coffees are among the best I've had in decaf. The flavors are rich, complex and balanced, with no strange aftertastes like I get with some decaf coffees. I've tried the decaf versions of French Roast, Major Dickason's Blend and House Blend. French Roast is the darkest and most robust of the three, a truly traditional and satisfying French roast style. Major Dickason's is dark-to-medium with superb combination of of bright and deep aromas, and makes an excellent brew, even at varying strengths. House Blend is a medium roast, the lightest of the three, and makes a delightfully smooth cup. All three are highly recommended!|1
19|19|I've tried so many different brands of coffee. This coffee is one of the best ones I have tried. It is bold and very good tasting coffee. A bit strong too. I do not need as much grind as I used on other brands when making coffee. This is great!|1
20|20|Delivered 10/5/17.  Product 'best purchased by' 10/11/17.  Not the first time this has happened; be careful when purchasing.  Always check dates before opening.|0
21|21|I used to work at Peets in college. For me there is no better coffee out there. My espresso always comes out beautifully with a perfect crema. Any coffee from Peets will always be bold but not bitter. I don’t know how they perfectly roast it (I should considering they put me through my senior year of college) but it is magical. Major Dickenson or Mocha Java is my choice of brewing coffee, too.|1
22|22|"I thought among the more experienced connoisseur reviews, there might also be some people out there like me who would benefit from a less refined but still specific perspective. E.g. Only a few years into making your own grinds, not a particularly experienced palate, and with some health needs when it comes to purchasing coffee.I'm a weird duck. Everyone from doctors to researchers to popular coffee websites all seem to advocate that darker roasts are the way to go if you're an acid sufferer. But dark roasts have always, always made me sick. For days after drinking them - regardless of brand - I have horrible acid. For that reason, I've also come to personally dislike the intense smokiness that many darker roasts have. Lighter roasts, for whatever reason, contrary to the prevailing wisdom, don't affect me in the slightest. Maybe I have weird gut pH? Go figure lol. But I'm very pleased to say this coffee doesn't affect my stomach at all.I've been searching for a coffee, starting with medium roasts (and will soon work my way up towards very light roasts, and see how that goes) that is flavorful and aromatic in a way that isn't smoky or ""roasty,"" but that is palpable and which doesn't hurt my stomach. And so far, this blend is a pretty good match for what I'm looking for.It's very mellow. It's also, despite my lack of experience, what I would say I think of when I envision a ""true"" medium roast. None of the beans are over-roasted. So many ""medium"" roasts can smell and taste like dark roasts to me, sometimes being even darker and ""roastier"" than other roasts labeled as dark! Not so here. Very, very mild, unless you extract for longer than 4 minutes. (I use a french press.) And even then, up to 6 minutes (yes I know you're not supposed to extract longer than 4 - I'm just explaining how mild it is), it only becomes very moderately more ""roasty.""And darned if it doesn't faintly smell of blueberries as claimed, due to the Ethiopian Super Natural inclusion in this blend. It's not as present as a blend centered completely around that hint, but it's there, faintly but pleasingly. At 4 minutes extraction, with non-boiled but just beginning to steam water (yes I know I should be more precise thermally) it tastes like what most people would probably call ""normal coffee."" Mellow, mild, but with that great blueberry, earthy aroma. At 5 minutes it's definitely stronger and more flavorful, but still very mild. At 6 minutes, it's JUST beginning to taste ""roasty"" and a little more smoky, but still not very better imo.If you love really dark roasted tasting coffee, this is not the blend for you. But if you just want a nice, smooth, mellow coffee, that also has decent body and a pleasing aroma (especially at longer extractions,) you might really enjoy this. The aftertaste is very mildly citrus, and doesn't ""tingle"" as much as other blends I've tried. I'm going to try some others, as I said moving up the roast lightness scale, but if none of them sit well with me, I could easily drink this as my daily coffee. No real downsides, not the most flavorful ever but definitely has presence and smells wonderful - although the aroma is as gentle and mellow as the flavor. I guess this is what people call ""balanced"" in the coffee world. If it is, I like it.Oh, and it has a bit less caffeine kick than some others I've tried. Which is either a good thing or not depending on what you want lol. Keep that in mind. Hope this helps someone out there with needs similar to mine."|1
23|23|'Cook's Illustrated' rated this coffee the best of medium roast coffees.  I am a coffee lover, and I love medium roast coffee. I could not find this coffee at my local supermarket, but did find it at Amazon. This is an expensive coffee at Amazon, $37.50 for two 12 -ounce bags. The supermarket charges $13.95 for a 1-pound bag.I like dark French Roast coffee, and I wanted a break. I found this coffee to be extremely smooth and bold. It is rich and with a chocolate toast flavor. This is what coffee should taste like. The beans seemed fresh and when ground had a remarkable odor. Peets is a coffee of renown, and is well known in the Northwest. It's gaining a foothold in the Northeast. My daughter in Seattle purchases only Peets, and when there is a sale, I buy in bulk. The smooth full-bodied taste of Peet's is what this brand is known for.  The Cafe Domingo coffee is one of the best coffees we can buy.Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-20-13|1
24|24|Coffee beans are obviously old. No aroma, absolutely no flavor. I'm stuck with 3 more bags which are of no use to me.|0
25|25|I've heard good things about this brand but the order I tit was sevverely burnt beans. I tossed them Into the trash.|0
26|26|"I love this coffee! I go through about 4 bags a month (thank you amazon subscribe and save) and I enjoy it very much. It is good hot or iced. This is not a coffee with a bitter after taste and it has a very smooth and rich taste. I don't really taste any ""mocha"" in this, but it's still my go to coffee. I found it originally at a Whole Foods in CA and I was paying nearly $12 per bag, but luckily, I found it on here and can usually get it for around $5 a bag with subscribe and save. I gave some to my friend to try and she loved it as well. I would highly recommend this coffee to anyone that loves a decaf dark roast coffee."|1
27|27|Try it for Peet's sake! I discovered this blend while on vacation last year. I had heard of Peet's but never tried it. Fast forward a year, and now I have tried a couple other blends from Peet's. In my opinion, the House Blend is the best. It is better than the Major Dickason Blend, which is much easier to find in stores for some reason. The House Blend just has the right balance for my tastes.|1
28|28|I elected to kick caffeine a few months ago, but still enjoy coffee.  It's hard to find dark roast decaf, so I was very happy to see this at Amazon.  Tastes pretty good, usually doesn't keep me awake. Way better than any of the alternatives I've found in local grocery stores.  I keep waiting for the price to shoot up, but so far it's remained a pretty good deal.The bags normally arrive in a non-vacume state (bag is floppy rather than rigid), but the grounds taste fresh enough for me.  The grind is about right for my drip coffee maker.|1
29|29|While I like this coffee, this is the fourth time getting coffee that is out of date. I usually order 4 bags at a time. Also the huge fluctuation in price is really annoying and off putting. I have started looking into other coffee so I don't have to deal with inconsistent pricing and dates.|0
30|30|I've been enjoying the espresso roast whole beans for use in my French press. The stores I frequent don't carry it, so I'm glad to find it here. Like all Peet's I've tried, the coffee has a great, full flavor. The espresso roast is just a great dark roast, plain and simple. So far, I haven't had issues with freshness or quality. My coffee only turns out bad when I occasionally burn it with too-hot water, or other factors. I also have a sensitive stomach and this doesn't seem to be overly acidic. Pairs well with So Delicious non-dairy creamer. I use a Hario burr grinder and nothing else fancy, so I can't report on espresso machine uses or anything. It's just d-mn good coffee, the kind of thing agent Dale Cooper would like.UPDATE 4/12/18: I've been grinding the espresso beans and making fantastic cold brew. Thought about trying other coffees for funsies, but this is tried and true. (I use a hemp filter bag and 60 oz Takeya pitcher.) The flavor holds up with the beans frozen until grinding.|1
31|31|This coffee has changed--and not for the better. It's not the rich, smooth, delicious Major Dickason's I've been making for years. It's pretty flavorless and thin, even though I use the same coffee-water ratio as ever. The package itself is slightly but noticeably different from the traditional one, and there are no images of this new package on either Google or Peet's website. This tells me that this bland junk might not be the authentic Peet's offering. Now I have to find a new source for my morning Peet's fix.|0
32|32|Peet's major dickason blend is by far my favorite coffee. It is bold yet not too acidic and have a solid long-lasting flavor. I find it not too strong for my first cup in the morning yet gives me enough of a kick to get me going.The coffee always comes fresh, and the beans usually still have an oil on them. I definitely prefer the whole beans and grind them myself to get the most flavor out of them. The one downside is that they go stale after about 2 weeks of after opening the package.|1
33|33|"I've been hand grinding this, super finely, to make Turkish coffee.  It works very well for that.  The only problem is that this uses it up very slowly, and I'm past the ""best by"" date, but it's still good for now.This roast is on the darker side of medium, and is not bad for making regular coffee with a different grind and a French press, although generally I prefer a dark roast for that."|1
34|34|Fresh Covfefe from Peets delivered to my door. It's great to have backstock of an essential like this. It's fresh in its sealed bag, just like from the Peets stores. The product dating is good. One comment though for price shoppers: There's a lot of variation in the coffee markets with bean prices, etc. Watching local grocery stores and stocking up on sales is probably the same or better than ordering online, which locks in a price that may change substantially with the season.|1
35|35|I really like Peet's House Blend and buy it when it is on sale at Amazon or my local grocer. It is rich and smooth and a great eye opener in the morning. It is now on my rotation of coffee's that I drink.|1
36|36|Peet's is best coffee I've had. I'm in my 60s. Get yourself a grinder and a French press and you will never drink Folger's or anything similar again. Comes in whole bean or ground. Worth every penny.|1
37|37|Great-tasting dark roast coffee. I remembered enjoying it years ago, when I had a french press and I thought dark roast was my favorite. Recently, I've been leaning more toward medium roast, but even more recently I acquired a french press and grinder, and it was time to buy beans again. I remembered Peet's and Major Dickason's, and wanted to try it again. I was concerned I wouldn't like it as much now, since I've been veering away from dark roasts, but it was just as I remembered. Great taste.|1
38|38|Can't believe how great this coffee is ... reminds me of Yeti Imperial Stout (IYKWIMAITYD)!!!  I've now put this on S&S, as I think it just might be my favorite.  With this in rotation with Kicking Horse Kick Ass and Ruta Maya Dark, you can't go wrong.  drf|1
39|39|My husband and I have tried a lot of brands of coffee. Peet's is by far our favorite. The dark blends are our go to. We use this 12 oz bag to fill our Keurig pods and it lasts us two weeks with about two 10 ounce cups a day. I'd describe it as a warm, smooth, smoky, nutty, rich flavor that will definitely wake you up. It's the Ghirardelli of coffee, in my personal opinion. Take that for what it's worth, Folger's is like dirty water to me and Dunkin' Donuts is so acidic that it turns my stomach.|1
40|40|We love this coffee and subscribe to receive it every month, so we don't have to worry that I will run out.  It is a nice, rich cup of coffee without being burnt or bitter. We typically make two 10-cup pots each morning just for the two of us. I take it with me when I travel with a single cup cone and filters so I am sure of a good cup wherever I am.|1
41|41|Can't beat Peets.  If you haven't tried Major Dickason's, you're missing out.  It's full bodied and dark, but I think it's the best selling of Peets Coffee.  One of my clients offered me Peets one day. They couldn't believe I hadn't had it. (This was years ago.) Anyway, it's a rich, incredible coffee. Costco in CA carries it, but here in NC they tried it and I guess it didn't sell too well.  It's the best, really.  You pay more for it, but it's worth it.|1
42|42|I love coffee and I subscribe to Mistobox which send me coffee every couple of weeks. But I love Peet's coffee because it's very cheap which means that I can drink tons of coffee and not go broke.Even though this coffee is less than ten bucks, it still tastes super good compared to other less expensive coffees.|1
43|43|I wanted to try darker roasted beans than what I usually get (Kimbo Superior - medium roast, excellent stuff, Italy). I was disappointed at first due to the bitterness but tasted some potential. I eventually dialed down my vintage Olympia Cremina lever espresso machine to pull shots at lower temperature. Results have been quite amazing. I am not good at describing flavors but it is only very slightly bitter if you use a lower temperature (if you machine allows for that) and tastes excellent, especially at the Amazon price. I recommend you try a bag.|1
44|44|This coffee turned out to be one of the better coffees I have tried. As I am new to the “grind then beans” scene, I have been trying different types. Pete’s Major Dickason blend was a pretty good coffee over all. However, with that being said, the price range to quality ratio is off. The price is a little high for a coffee that doesn’t completely blow me away. Like most coffee and other food products it’s all up to personal preference however.|1
45|45|Absolutely best dark roast decaf available! Rich, deep nutty flavor. Excellent for regular, bold, iced coffee and expressso. Brews the best cup of coffee I've ever made with my Ninja Coffee Bar IQ. Also does great with my Keurig 2.0 and Hamilton Beach 49981A Single Serve Scoop Coffee Maker. Tastes even better with sweetened Half & Half froth.I've found my new fav!|1
46|46|Very disappointed.  Ordered Feb 12, received Feb 14, Best Buy date Feb 26 (3 months after roast date).  I can't drink a 12oz bag of ground coffee in 12 days and 3 month old ground coffee is pretty stale anyway.  This was for ground decaf.  I ordered the most popular blend, Major Dickason, in hopes of avoiding this problem.  I also ordered Major Dickason whole beans.  Those were also 3 months after the roast date, but beans last longer than ground so I guess I'll keep them.  The ground will be returned.|0
47|47|My brother turned me on to this coffee last November (2017). I was drinking Kirkland's Brand decaf (roasted by Starbucks) beans that I ground myself and that was pretty good. However, this has to be one of the best grocery bought, pre-ground coffee I've had. It isn't bitter or acidic, is so smooth and full bodied. It really is the best thing I look forward to each morning. I wish I could find it in the stores around me though so I don't have to order it but I have yet to find a store that carries the decaf, and forget about trying to find the beans to grind yourself. So, I'll settle for this for now.|1
48|48|not sure if I got a bad gab.. tasted and smelled horrible.  Others seem to like so maybe i just got a bad bag.|0
49|49|Every one of the 5 bags expires in less than a month from the day I received it.  This is just unacceptable.|0
50|50|WOW. This light roast is FULL of flavor. Aromatic with vanilla and fruity notes. Light. Crisp. Flavorful. If the bag didn't say light roast I would not have believed it. I used the inverted AeroPress method. And for THAT PRICE! This is a steal! Peet's is hands down THE BEST coffee money can buy.|1
51|51|I have been using the Peet's Coffee Colombia for 5 years and I love it but this one taste very different/bad from the colombia I'm used to drink. I bought 4 packs here, the packs arrived sealed and looks in normal condition but something is wrong with the grain, it's taste awful, totally different of Colombia one.I opened three packages, I tried all them but it had taste the same.|0
52|52|Tasty every time I get it and I just mix with a little caffeinated coffee and I'm good to good. Lots of flavor, unlike most decaf coffees|1
53|53|If this isn't one of the best cups of coffee you ever had then I will be shocked. If it was legal for me to do it, I would almost give you your money back. The only coffee I think is better than this one is Trader Joe's Wintry Blend. You will love this and you'll be all jacked up on caffeine and super productive. Get it. Sip it. Hold it in your heart. Hug it because you know you want to. Coffee is God.|1
54|54|Everyone says they are a coffee snob.  Even the ones that love coffee I can't stand.  This stuff is one of the best all-around coffees which is great to drink hot or make a great cold-brew.  I wish it came in bulk options because the price has set me off to explore other options which, are widely available in a competitive coffee market.  When it's on sale, I buy it.|1
55|55|Bought 4 bags and all of them say best if purchased 3 months ago|0
56|56|Peet's Coffee Brazil Minas Naturais, Medium Roast, Ground 12oz -I wish they wouldn't mix different products in the same reviewsAt this price point I'd give it a 6 if I could.I have no problem paying 9 bucks for a 12oz bag of Peets French Roast,etc.But this price? I had to come back and check to see if I hadn't gotten over on a price mistake,but nope.I might have to demote the Major.|1
57|57|My coffee arrived with an expiration date of 12/31/17. It's part of a Christmas gift. I highly doubt they will use it in a week. Very disappointing...|0
58|58|Very god coffee. I used to drink Starbucks French Roast, but got a sort of sour flavor as the cup cooled. I even tried some French roast from a local coffee shop, but noticed the same problem as the coffee started to cool. Peets has a nice rich flavor that stays that way even when the coffee starts to cool. I like it so much I subscribed for regular deliveries.|1
59|59|"It's quite bitter almost like an espresso; and I like that. It's espresso enough to make an iced-coffee with it. Does it taste good? Well... maybe a little deeper taste than Maxwell coffee. It's grinded, so don't expect the same quality from freshly grinded whole beans. Do I recommend it? Well, yeah actually if you like strong bitterness of coffee. Speaking of bitterness, does it taste ""sour""? Actually no, and that's a big plus."|1
60|60|Great decaf coffee.  Still searching for my favorite, but this will be my go to for a while.  I like a bold cup of coffee in the morning and can’t drink much caffeine anymore.  Finding a good decaf - particularly one that is not processed with chemicals - is a challenge.  I’d recommend trying it!|1
61|61|As advertised, an excellent Dark Roast coffee intended for a thank you package to the coffee lover...I bought several brands to say thank you for a deed well done and will post this review in each. This one was to represent the Pacific Northwest's love affair with dark roasted whole bean coffees and how they blend different beans into specific flavor profiles....dj|1
62|62|I make coffee at night and it's ready when I get up, and it the greatest thing to wake up to.  I have to add it tasted good also.  I've tried all kinds of coffee and PEERS dark ground is the best I have found.  I grew up with the store brand and there ok, but  PEETS coffee. Is on the top shelf and I don't know if there is anything better.  In looking but haven't found one compared to PEERS dark roast coffee.|1
63|63|It smells good but found ground and thought I made mistaken. I could not return because 6 weeks after delivered it.I took two proven photos if seller contact me|0
64|64|"I had been looking for a good tasting decaf coffee, due to ""no sleep"" issues and was certain that I would have to settle for ok coffee.  I was impressed by the reviews this one received so I gave it a try.  Let me tell you this is the BEST coffee ever, decaf or not.  I love it.  Thanks ""Peet"" for coming up with this blend.  I'll be a customer forever."|1
65|65|I have this as a subscribe and save item. The best by dates are usually very close to when I receive the coffee, however this month I received it on January 5th and the best by date had already passed-- January 1st. I will go back to buying from the supermarket if this happens again...Update- just received a bag dated 3/21/18. Today is 5/8/18. They are sending old coffee.|0
66|66|Major Dickenson's blend is a robust, dark raost coffee. It has a true sweet note to it, but without any strange flavors that can alter the true coffee flavor.In my Cuisinart extreme brew coffee maker I add 1 heading teaspoon of ground coffee for each cup of coffee I want to make. It turns out prefect every time.|1
67|67|Great coffee beans. Gave this as a gift to my husband for his new espresso machine from santa :-)He says it taste really good and the beans grind perfectly. Will forsure buy again when he needs more.|1
68|68|I love Pete's Big Bang coffee when buying it ground in the store. So I Thought Whole Bean Would Be better Because It Would Be fresher. This coffee has a slight fruity taste, which is really brought out by the fresh bean! I actually don't like it as well. But the product ordered was exactly as described!|1
69|69|I found this coffee too light and sweet for my personal tastes, but I appreciate that others will probably like it.  There's very little earthiness or smokiness, yet it has a heavier mouth feel.  It drinks fairly smooth, though the acidity is noticeable after a few sips.  There is a distinct caramel/toffee sweetness that lingers in the aftertaste.|1
70|70|I LOVE this coffee. It's flavorful without being overpowering. I highly recommend this. However, I placed my order on 12-23. The package said it was roasted on 9/28 and freshest by 12/17. If anyone appreciates fresh coffee, just be aware and see if you can find out about dates before purchasing.|1
71|71|I got teo packages of this coffee and the best purchased by date is in a week! The guaranteed fresh date is also only one week from today. It was a subscribe and save order but I am not buying this product again|0
72|72|Good taste for coffee and good price. I do not like acidic tasting coffee, and this coffee does not taste acidic while giving a good flavor. Whole bean so you can grind the beans yourself!|1
73|73|Good taste for coffee and good price. I do not like acidic tasting coffee, and this coffee does not taste acidic while giving a good flavor. Whole bean so you can grind the beans yourself!|1
74|74|This coffee is special.  You cannot tell it is a decaf coffee, so you get real, full bodied flavor without the caffeine jitters.  I make a big thermos and I drink it all day at work.  Of course, you still get some caffeine, but that’s not a bad thing.  This particular blend is their most popular.|1
75|75|I'm a die hard coffee lover who has had to drink decaf for the last 15 years.  I like a dark, robust coffee. This is absolutely the best and the closest there is to drinking a full bodied caffeinated coffee. Love it and will continue to buy it. I can also find it locally and when on sale it's less that he Amazon price. Good to shop around.|1
76|76|"I bought 3 bags of coffee and when I received them, they were almost at their ""freshest by"" date.  It is not possible to use that much coffee in the space of a week!  This is the second time this has happened to me.  This is my favorite coffee but I will stop buying it through Amazon if you can't supply coffee that is almost past its best."|0
77|77|This is the best de-caf.  expensive but worth the price.  It can stand alone and hold it's own. sometimes, I use half decaf and half caf depending on the time of day.  For my money, Peet's is the best coffee any6way.  I look for a sale too.  I dk if Amazon has sales on this item.  TRY this decaf if you like French roast.  You will love it. You won't be able to tell the difference between the decaf and regular.  I mix it with other coffee too.|1
78|78|This is one of my all-time favorite brands of coffee! As an avid coffee drinker for the past 10 years, this is my go-to blend for my cup o' Joe! I highly recommend this - and the price is fairly comparable to your local grocery store. Very pleased!|1
79|79|great tasting for capuccino in an aeropress.|1
80|80|I can't drink coffee too late at night, but my husband has a cup after dinner every night.  Sometimes when I'm feeling jealous of his steaming cup of coffee, I have a cup too and regret it later when I can't get to sleep.  This has been my solution!  This decaf coffee has me fooled,  I can't tell a difference in the taste from this and the caffeinated variety.|1
81|81|Best decaf ever. At the time I bought it was around six dollars and now amazon isn’t selling anymore, so I’m going to assume it was old stock. Still tasted good- I use a 12 oz French press if that is information you need. If you see this at the store, stock up!|1
82|82|I'm always on the lookout for good strong coffee. So when I was on a trip to California and had my first cup of Peets Coffee at a cafe, I decided to order some via Amazon when I got back. Major Dickason's Blend is justifiably a dark/deep roast and did not disappoint. I prefer a dark roast but if you prefer a medium roast this is still a good option (I would just use a little less grounds) but the flavor is good either way. I am giving it 4 stars because for an inexpensive coffee this is a great option. I've spent a lot more money on other coffees that did not have the taste or quality that Peets Coffee has.|1
83|83|My son says that Peet's Coffee is the best coffee because it tastes so fresh.  It tends to be one of the most expensive grocery store brands so I usually buy it from Amazon for slightly less.  This was the first time I bought the light roast and my son liked it very much.|1
84|84|"The best part of the coffee is no bitter aftertaste as in some.  I am not sure if it's worth the price or not though, and probably won't order again as I'm not a ""coffee snob"".  LOL.  It is recommended online as one of the top 2 brands, so wanted to give it a try."|1
85|85|Really like this coffee. I was given a Dash Button as a present to be able to order this easily.Unfortunately the last two orders I’ve received were either past expiration date or within 2days of the expiration. I’m very disappointed in Amazon not sending fresh products.|0
86|86|"Second time ordering; it is most definitely NOT ""roast to order"". Both bags were roasted 2 months prior to me receiving said bag(s) of coffee beans. Don't get me wrong, I quite enjoy this coffee. However, shouldn't put ""roast to order"" in the advertisement if it's not actually ""roast to order"""|0
87|87|I was a 'nothing but Starbucks' guy for about 15 years until I decided to try a bag of whole bean Peets Major Dickason's Blend coffee.It's impossible to go back now. If you enjoy full-flavored coffee that doesn't have a burnt taste, give this one a try.|1
88|88|Was hoping for something fresh for my espresso maker. Beans were over 2 months old, no way to know what you are going to get. I am sure if you are making drip coffe they would be fine, but picky espresso drinkers like me will keep looking.|0
89|89|This tastes like stale, supermarket brand coffee or what you find in your cup at a diner. Not all what I know Peet’s to be. Think ransid decaf but it’s not decaf. Such a disappointment. Returning for refund. Will stick with my usual vendor for authentic Peet’s coffee.|0
90|90|My wife and I really like this coffee.  It is dark, bold and smooth.  Not bitter.  It is our go to coffee.  PS you can also get at a major club chain owned by the walden's.|1
91|91|buying this by the case.  its taste and feel is excellent. a rich dark roast, hearty and a great wake up for the mornings.|1
92|92|Looove this coffee!|1
93|93|Peet's coffee is about the only decaf that actually has some flavor ... this is a dark roast and I think slightly darker than Peet's House Blend decaf.  Both tastes great and are you best choice if you like bold coffee taste but want to avoid the cafeine.|1
94|94|Very strong.  Great espresso forte dark.  The flavor is intense espresso.  Not as much crema.  after tasting this, I would opt down to medium roast next time.  It's a bit too strong for me.  The organic espresso at TJ is even stronger than this.|1
95|95|As always, Peet's is a tremendous coffe, then Amazon adds to the experience by delivering it to my door, free (with Prime)...Jim|1
96|96|So I've had this coffee in the past and all ways enjoyed it. So I ordered some. I received it and looked at the best by date and it was already past due. If it was whole beans I would not have thought anything of it but unfortunately it was pregrounded coffee. Was very irritated by this but it was the only coffee in the house. So I tried it. Tasted good. Almost like I remember but still. Why would you send me a bag of ground coffee that is past the freshest by date???????????????|0
97|97|This coffee has a bold strong taste to it. It is a blend for someone who has a game plan for the day and is ready to get started. To be honest I’ve been told I’m like the energizer bunny after I’ve had a cup. Bold, strong deep flavor. I highly recommend to all coffee drinkers.|1
98|98|Yum, my family loves dark roast coffee that  is bold and bright and rich enough to add cream and sweetener. Thanks Amazon for the incredibly low price compared to the grocery store. This coffee was sent to all my five kids for their Christmas treat, free Prime ship and low price for me and great morning java for my kids!  This brand retails for $8 in most stores.|1
99|99|Love auto delivery. Perfect for me as the coffee is of great import in my life (in other words, if I don't have it, I am NOT happy! But- watch the prices as they seem to change from month to month. If you stay on top of that, its great!|1
100|100|Great beans. I go back to this often for my espresso machine. Keeps well and smells amazing.|1
101|101|"We ordered in mid-August. Product was roasted in January, and the ""best buy"" date was April.The coffee is vacuum-packed and tastes fine. I  would prefer that the product arrive before its ""best buy"" date has expired."|1
102|102|"Pete's Italian Roast is great!  But if the beans are not fresh, it tastes like what it is--coffee that has sat around too long before it has been ground and brewed.  My orders arrived too close to the ""best before"" date for the coffee to be good."|0
103|103|"Holy Crap!!! If you like dark roast coffee then this is the coffee for you! From now on this is the only coffee I'm going to buy. It has a rich, dark, incredibly robust flavor. I never thought I would ever use the words ""robust flavor"" in my life but it fits. I opened the package, made a cup with my french press and walked out of the room. Came back in an hr later and I could still smell that great smell. Buy this and you won't regret it."|1
104|104|How do I love thee? Let me count the ways:1) You are always roasted dark and rich without any hint of burnt beans (I am scowling at you Starbucks!)2) You go through our superautomatic espresso machine without clogging up the works3) You are so well balanced that my hubby likes you black and you are robust enough to withstand my cream and vanilla sugar4) You are priced right for how good you are and are on sale oftenThank you for waking us up with a smile on our faces!|1
105|105|I adore strong coffee but most every decaf blend has been sorely lacking. This is every bit as great as a regular caffeinated bold roast and I could not be more thrilled.|1
106|106|Peets Decaf is as strong as regular -- and that is almost impossible to find. It brews into a full-bodied cup of coffee!  It tastes the same as their  non-decaf,  and I've been searching for that for years. Thank you, Peets.|1
107|107|The best decaf you will ever drink. None of their blends has that horrible decaf taste. This is the only decaf I buy. I can't say enough good about it.  Anytime people come by they ask what the brand is.|1
108|108|This coffee is amazing!  I love Peets!  I had bought it in March for my daughter for her Bday.  She loved it so much, I decided to try.  ...so good!|1
109|109|My fav coffee. I use the caffeinated in the morning. Serve the decaf at night for dinner parties.  Sometimes I mix the two to lower the caffeine but still give me a morning jolt. If you like strong bold coffee that goes down smooth this is GREAT!|1
110|110|Peet’s Whole Bean Italian Roast is simply the best coffee you can buy anywhere, period. I get six bags in regular monthly shipments for a 5% discount. Best deal in town.|1
111|111|Not happy about this at all. I received 2 bags of ground coffee that had expiration of Feb 11 2018. I received on Feb. 6th. It will take almost 2 months to go through this coffee, well past expiration, not right and contemplating buying elsewhere.|0
112|112|Really love this rich, dark coffee - this is our go-to daily coffee. Roasted date is recent - no worries about getting old coffee here, and, it's WAY cheaper on Amazon - $6 (with Amazon Subscribe & Save) versus $9 at our local grocery store!|1
113|113|"This is my favorite grocery store coffee. I was pleased that the package I received wasn't even close to the ""best by"" date (especially since I ordered it when when there was a price drop)."|1
114|114|Best decaf ever. Full body taste , no bitterness or buzz.|1
115|115|The freshest and the best, especially ifyou’re a dark roast fan!|1
116|116|I made this in exactly the same way I always make coffee in my small two cup pot. It was very smooth but flat with no body!  I like coffee a bit strong with a little bite. This was not that...Blah! Now I'll have to suffer with it until it's gone or throw it away. Sorry, Peet's!|0
117|117|Roast date on pkg was within 20 days of purchase date both times I bought from Amazon.  Peets is the only brand that puts that date front and center.  Will be my staple coffee until I can find something fresher.|1
118|118|This was on my regular Subscribe & Save Delivery.  Today, I received my normal 4 packages with Roasted Dates of 04/05/2018, Freshest by 07/04 which is only two weeks out.  No way will wel consume 4 packages in 2 weeks.  Previous deliveries were roasted within the previous month with a two month freshest by window.  Removing from my Subscribe & Save list...|0
119|119|LOVE THIS BEAN!! A big box shows up and my mornings are much better. 😊👍🏻☕️☕️☕️|1
120|120|This is about as good as decaf gets and it is nice to know it was processed in a wholesome way. As far as the price, I got it as an add-on item, at just under seven dollars. The time before I had looked, the price was twice as expensive. Now I now how good the coffee is, when the price is reasonable again I'll stock up.|1
121|121|Best coffee that I've ever tasted !!!First time I used a french press as well ☕Spend and extra 20 bucks on a grinder ... it makes a world of a difference 🌎#WHOLEBEANS #PETESCOFFEW #FRENCHPRESS #THEBEST|1
122|122|By far my husband'a very favorite coffee! He loves everything about it, so I keep several bags in the house all of the time. Our visitors always loves it too!|1
123|123|By far our favorite coffee of all time.  Not too strong, very smooth with no bitter aftertaste.  Truly the best coffee we have had anywhere.  We keep this stocked at our house all the time and it's the only coffee I brew daily.  We keep trying other coffees as a backup/replacement as our store no longer carries the Cafe Domingo,  but we haven't found anything that we like near as much as this.|1
124|124|"The coffee is tasty and not at all bitter.  I was just expecting a little more ""bang"" of flavor given the name.  I would buy Peet's again but will look for a different roast/flavor."|1
125|125|"Great coffee, but these arrived most of the way through their short shelf life, so subscribing to a monthly batch of these would mean a very old grind half the time.  I guess people who care more grind their own beans, but even for my low-end palette, I try to keep myself within the ""use by"" date, and a monthly delivery of a three-week-old grind isn't a good deal. I'll keep stocking up locally."|0
126|126|burnt and bitter---Just like Sturbaux. Need milk and sugar. You either like it or hate it.|0
127|127|Smooth and beautiful. Can't wait to tr the their flavors. Just wish amazon offered more in whole bean.|1
128|128|I have been very disappointed with many brands of coffee over the last few years but I have recently discovered Peet's and have tried several of their medium roasts settling on Cafe Domingo. It's loaded with flavor and has a satisfying finish.|1
129|129|The coffee is fantastic....Wish it was in a package with no aluminum inside, but it tastes wonderful!!  The USPS delivered it, and though my address says BACK APARTMENT, they give it to my neighbor in front of the building.  There was never an instruction to do that, and they are the only delivery service that screws up all the time.|1
130|130|Found this gem at the grocery store and decided to give it a try. I'm now addicted to the flavor.|1
131|131|I Just received a new order of this coffee and the roasting date is older then the previous order from 3 weeks ago. I expect newer/fresher. Buyer beware.|0
132|132|I use this coffee half-and-half with Peet's regular French roast. I cannot tell you how much I love it. The local store literally can't keep it on the shelves.|1
133|133|If you think coffee is just coffee, you haven't tried Peet's! This blend is so smooth and not the least bit bitter. My son, who believes all coffee tastes the same, is even impressed.|1
134|134|Very decent coffee that has a lighter medium roast. I see this coffee as a  reasonable choice for a budget choice but think personally the Equal Exchange Mind Body and Soul to be a better choice.|1
135|135|My absolute favorite blend. Very smooth. Has a slightly sweet taste with little bitterness.|1
136|136|My favorite coffee, dark roast, high caffeine, smooth flavor, and perfect for a French press. It's my weekend morning treat. I can buy it cheaper on Amazon than I can at the grocery store.|1
137|137|I like to roast my own beans but sometimes it just doesn't get done. So when I need a fallback, this is it! Good flavor for a store bought bean. Never bitter.|1
138|138|GREAT COFFEE FOLKS ESPECIALLY WHEN USED WITH MY FRENCH PRESS !!!|1
139|139|The price online is slightly cheaper than in the supermarkets but it's difficult to find the 20oz bags anywhere.  I absolutely love Peets and recommend every roast possible, although my favorite is Major Dickinson (bold flavor).  Stock up!|1
140|140|I have been searching for Brazilian coffee, sadly it is hard to acquire lately. I use this in a pour over and it is very flavorful. I find it fits the bill for a decent medium blend.|1
141|141|This is the best decaf coffee ever.  We love it and never use any other kind. It dark roast, rich and strong coffee.|1
142|142|This is always my favorite coffee and it arrives quickly enough that it is fresh for a few weeks! The small size allows me to drink it and not have it all go back.It has a chocolate-y flavor and I like it best brewed strong with added heavy whipping cream.|1
143|143|Favorite coffee; smells amazing!|1
144|144|We always like Peet’s coffees, and this is another to add to that list. We like a small cup of french-pressed strong coffee after dinner, and this suits us nicely for that purpose.|1
145|145|This is my favorite coffee of all time. Dark roast, super caffeinated, just lovely in my French press. When I have guests, they always want to know what brand I'm using.|1
146|146|love this coffee.  Have been drinking it for about 5 years!!  Frequently the best price is from Amazon.  The roasted date is usually good too, except for the time I ordered 3 in a subscribe and save shipment. The coffee was just as tasty at the end of those 3 bags as it was the first, so if I get an older 'roasted on date', no cause for concern.|1
147|147|I love Peets Coffee and Major Dickasons is my all time favorite.  I would only buy this in my local supermarket when it was on sale which lateley has been non existent.  I only drink this coffee on the weekends because I will not rush it. I want to be able to sit and relax and enjoy every drop.When I saw the price I was so happy and since I am a prime member I got it fast and free (shipping that is).  I will definetely order it again.|1
148|148|Peet's is one of my favorite. Major Dickason's is a really flavorful and dark blend, tiny bit of smokiness. It's great to mix with other blends of coffee as well.|1
149|149|The coffee beans are quite old. The shelf life expires October 2018. They are ok, but should be sold at a discounted price due to lack of freshness. I had to mix the beans with fresh beans to use them...|0
150|150|Might be the best coffee I have ever had.  Excellent flavor and aroma.  Been buying it for gifts too.  And yes it did go up in price!!|1
151|151|Big Bang whole bean roast is so good, it compares favorably to stuff I can get from local roasters. Definitely one of my monthly staples.|1
152|152|I just received my second order of this coffee and we love it. It is so smooth and not bitter. It's my new favorite!|1
153|153|Fantastic coffee!|1
154|154|I saw a review online that listed this as one of the best coffees out there so I ordered it for my husband. He says it really is good. I will be purchasing this again.|1
155|155|Very strong coffee when making espresso, far bitter to my taste. After this I will go back to the Major Dickason's Blend.|0
156|156|this is the best coffee i have purchased from Amazon.  If you like a robust coffee, I would highly reccommed it.|1
157|157|I tried this with my ninja coffee machine and used the cafe setting and it tastes great!!!|1
158|158|Meh... It's like normal coffee.  Guess I'm getting to be a coffee snob.  It was fresh though so I gave it 4 stars|1
159|159|Love the product but again, shipped from amazon, vacuum seal was broken.  That is the whole point of keeping coffee beans fresh.  How do I get a refund?!|0
160|160|Excellent!  Trying to cut back on caffeine and this coffee tastes just like regular coffee!|1
161|161|For me it's a medium roast. Though it has a good taste, it can't compete with Starbucks espresso roast because it is not dark enough.|0
162|162|Very close to the best to be consumed date. Less than two weeks left...|0
163|163|Fresh ground, this is hands down my favorite coffee to brew in my French press.  It has so much flavor and is so reasonably priced!|1
164|164|Have used Peet’s for several years; when only available online. After trip to Italy, wanted good espresso & found this to be quite good! Still miss Italy, but duh!|1
165|165|Best decaffeinated coffee ever. This stuff ricks hard. I love it. No decaf taste and its full bodied and strong like I used to drink before I had to switch to decaf.|1
166|166|Best tasting coffee ever! And love the smell too. When you taste this coffee, you will think Dunkin Donuts coffee is fake. I put this already on my subscribe & save|1
167|167|My go-to brand and flavor for most occasions, like just waking up on a typical morning. If you like it and want to keep it on stock, it's cheaper on Amazon or on the Peet's website than buying in most stores.|1
168|168|Not saying anything negative about the coffee or the maker, but I honestly hated the taste of this coffee.  Just tasted awful.|0
169|169|I love, love, this coffee.  I have used it every morning for at least a year and I never get tired of it.|1
170|170|I don't really care for the taste of coffee, especially Starbucks. Peet's coffee is freakin delicious!|1
171|171|Coffee had old expiration date|0
172|172|Damn! This stuff is good.I just had my first cup and it's better than the caffeinated dark roast blend I'm using right now.If you've been trying to find something that's decaf, that has the same boldness of fully-leaded joe, then this is it!Wow, to be honest, this is better. I'm a fan. Plain and simple.|1
173|173|Makes delicious cold brew, the perfect amount of sweet and bitter when a splash of cream is added.|1
174|174|I'ts not that I hate the coffee, I love Peet's, but Amazon gave me 2 bags of nearly expired coffee!! Today's date: 12/15/2017. Bag date: 12/17/2017. I'm pretty pissed.|0
175|175|Taste is obviously subjective, but this coffee has a little too much of a unique flavor for my liking.|0
176|176|Excellent coffee but surprised and disappointed that this expires in just a couple of weeks.  5 for taste, 2 for being forced to use it so quickly.|0
177|177|This is pretty good for regular drip coffee. The greatest thing is that it's available on Amazon and in n many grocery stores. I would not use this for espresso though. I did and was not satisfied with the quality of flavor.|1
178|178|This roast makes my stomach sick. Ive ordered the Major Dickasons roast multiple times before and I was impressed by the flavor and wanted to try a lighter roast from this brand. I've tried multiple brewing methods: French press, cold brew, and pour over; each method makes my stomach upset. It has an okay flavor but I can't stand the way it makes me feel.|0
179|179|The date it was fresh until was out of date I ordered on the 29th of October and fresh until date was October 26 .I will give it to my brother he doesn't care . I just didn't want to serve it to  my guests.|0
180|180|Great flavor! Only gripe is my coffee maker has a reusable steel mesh filter and with how finely ground the coffee is, some gets through it. Other than that, great coffee!|1
181|181|Good variety coffee bean; but nothing special: plus you can't keep any coffee bean fresh for long after you open the package|1
182|182|Forte Espresso was terribly over roasted. It was undrinkable, too bitter. I actually love strong, somewhat bitter espresso but no bueno, awful.|0
183|183|Peet's has been our favorite for years.  We were so happy to find it at Amazon.This is their darkest roast, and tastiest.|1
184|184|Bought some to supplement my coffee bean direct S&S and it is a nice rich roast that makes some fantastic espresso!|1
185|185|My favorite coffee every morning at a great price, thanks to Amazon!|1
186|186|The coffee itself is delicious and I highly recommend it. The reason for the one-star rating is that the coffee with stale. According to the label on the side, the coffee was nearly 3 months past its recommended use-by date.|0
187|187|I've had different Peet's coffee's before, and always enjoyed the. It seems that Major Dickason's is the most popular blend, and while I like that one too the Colombia blend has always been my favorite. The packages delivered were fresh and excellent.|1
188|188|Been buying Peet's off for years but this was a first for Amazon.  Love Peet's coffee.|1
189|189|This is my favorite coffee all that I drink at home--and the price is great!  Peets has a deep roasted flavor and the beans are always fresh.|1
190|190|This is our favorite coffee blend. We buy whole bean to control the grind for our French Press|1
191|191|Produces a nice crema in our espresso machine and tastes fantastic.  At this price, I'm a repeat customer.|1
192|192|This is the best  coffee ever  This is the only coffee and I buy now  I highly recommend this coffee|1
193|193|Excellent! My favorite new coffee! Rich flavor, nice beans. My new favorite!|1
194|194|I'm a big fan of Peets coffee  and usually purchase the house blend but decided to try this and although I gave it a five star review I probably will continue to purchase the house blend in the future. The taste was good and not bitter but I prefer a little stronger of a blend.|1
195|195|Bold coffee with no bitter after taste; mixes very well with organic beans; grinds cleanly.|1
196|196|When you read the other reviews that this coffee is exceptional...they are correct.  Love the aroma and wish I had found this great coffee sooner.  It is very satisfying to the best of the coffee lover's taste buds.|1
197|197|The coffee was roasted last year! The fresh date was February 12th, 2018. It’s May!|0
198|198|Big Bang coffee is great in the morning AND late in the day . . . can't say a bad word about PEETS|1
199|199|I am in no way a coffee connoisseur but I have been testing out a number of the brewing options along with using different brands of coffee. So far I've tried Instant, perk and french press using pre-ground (usually too fine a grind); this was my first attempt at grinding my own. These beans looked beautiful having a nice dark roast and fresh shiny appearance to go along with the great aroma each time I open the bag. The burr grinder simply enhances the sensory experience.Using this in a french press I can see this is the best flavored coffee I have yet made at home. To me it's nice and bold while not being bitter. I prefer bold but not bitter in the morning but do enjoy slightly bitter coffee after a meal and with sweet desert. This has definitely become my morning cup of java but I also will not hesitate to pair it with a sweet desert.I'm sure this review is a bit skewed when comparing these freshly ground beans to pre-ground but I do have to say it easily rivals the grind-on-demand cups of coffee I have enjoyed out-and-about.|1
200|200|This is our favorite coffee.  It is dark and bold, which as a black coffee drinker I love and my husband, who puts milk and sugar in his coffee, loves because the flavor still comes through.|1
201|201|Disappointed that this arrived with an expiration date within 8 days. Going to keep and hope it's still good once I open it.|1
202|202|Like it better than Starbuck's and i'm an avid Starbuck's fan.|1
203|203|Perfect replacement for my discontinued Marques De Paiva Breakfast Blend.  Very smooth and fresh tasting, with a perceived slightly higher caffeine content than other medium or dark roasted Peet's blends.  Highly recommend trying!|1
204|204|An outstanding coffee. Rich, complex, velvety flavors. I'm very impressed at Peet's. I haven't yet found any of their coffees that I wasn't impressed with.|1
205|205|Don't buy this coffee bean. It is not fresh.|0
206|206|I've never liked Peet's coffee, until they started the medium roast ones.  This one is perfectly decent but Big Bang is richer.|0
207|207|I asked a friend who moved to France, what I could bring to her and she said this!|1
208|208|Not bad for an inexpensive coffee really I think I liked it better than the Starbucks Italian Roast Dark Roast Ground.|1
209|209|"Be prepared to answer the question ""Are you SURE this is decaf?"" when your guests take their first sip. Simply the best decaf around; dark, rich, velvety with just enough acid to liven the flavor. I haven't done a blind taste test yet, but I suspect it would be tough to distinguish from Pete's 'normal' French Roast."|1
210|210|Package came quickly but very disappointed to see the freshest by date was the same as the date I received it.|0
211|211|To my surprise this coffee was an excellent choice.  This was my first time trying Peet's Coffee and the Major Dickasons's Blend has a strong robust flavor that was just what I was looking for.  Highly recommend.  Also, the price is excellent, I just saw it in my neighborhood grocery store (NYC) for $13.89 for the same size, so this was a bargain.|1
212|212|Always good coffee.|1
213|213|I really enjoy Peet's coffee and have tried many of their roasts.  I like them all, and can't pick a favorite.  Make sure you specify whole bean or ground when you order.|1
214|214|PERSONALLY NOT FOR ME. not to my personal taste|0
215|215|Espresso Forte is my favorite. I hate to admit it, but I even like it more than any of the local roasters.|1
216|216|I LOVE coffee. But I am not a coffee connoisseur, I make this in my espresso machine and it's brilliant tasting and wonderful.|1
217|217|I didn't catch this was a dark roast. I am more of a medium roast kind of person but thought I would try it anyways. I put one less scoop than normal in with my coffee and it was great. Would recommend this for someone who wants a full flavored coffee on the stronger end.|1
218|218|I bought this in Nov last year and only started trying it recently and I am hooked!This coffee has a pleasant aroma, stronger than typical watered-down regular coffee and yet not acidic. It drinks well even on an empty stomach!|1
219|219|Excellent coffee. I drink a lot of coffee and sometimes experience heartburn because of it. I haven't had any with this blend. This coffee is so smooth with a nice bold flavor.|1
220|220|I love Peet’s coffee and ordered because I have an injury and could not get to the store. I was disappointed in that the expiration dates were not far out ( only 3 weeks).|1
221|221|We love Peets coffee. It is full-bodied, every bit as good as Starbucks, and a good price on Amazon, especially on Subscribe and Save.|1
222|222|Ok coffee roast is a bit bitter , dose not have a good after taste, but in a pinch will do out the the best this gets a 6 out of 10|1
223|223|Decent coffee, definitely prefer Peet's whole bean. The pre-ground is usually too thin.|1
224|224|My husband loves Peet’s coffee but is not a big fun of this particular one. He is stumptown coffee kind of guy.|0
225|225|I received this product two days after the 'best used before' date. What a disappointment!|0
226|226|We love this blend, price was good, although a grocery store sale is still the best.|1
227|227|My go-to coffee for everything from cold brew to espresso. Versatile, deep and rich.|1
228|228|Finding a dark rich roast decaf is a bit of a challenge.  Peet’s nails it for my husband.|1
229|229|I'll never drink any other coffee again. Peet's is the best!|1
230|230|Tastes better than any Starbucks I've ever tried.|1
231|231|The flavor is mostly fine, a bit bitter, I think my batch was over ground, it's far too fine.|0
232|232|The very best. You want as close to non-decaf coffee taste you can get? This one is it. Make it strong.|1
233|233|Peet's is the BEST!  I wished there were more blends available through Amazon such as Garuda, Sulawesi Kalosi.|1
234|234|Full bodied flavor not often found in decaffeinated coffees fine ground but not espresso ground|1
235|235|"Package was almost at the ""use by"" date.  Pretty mediocre espresso. Nowhere near as tasty for espresso as Peet's Major Dickason."|0
236|236|A good blend, mild yet a bit of power.  Way better than anything from Starbuck's.|1
237|237|Packs a fresh punch. Works every time. Colt... I mean Peet's.|1
238|238|Okay, but a little bitter aftertaste.  Not my favorite, but I would order in a pinch.|1
239|239|One of my favorite Coffee blends. I sent this out as a gift to a friend. This particular blend, while being a dark roast, is not as bitter as some, and a good bit smoother. This is one of my everyday kind of coffees to drink.|1
240|240|Best cup of decaf around!  Rich and smooth.  Makes me hesitate to have decaf out.  I'd rather enjoy this delicious coffee at home!|1
241|241|This is my favorite coffee at a great price. It arrived promptly and the packaging was perfect.|1
242|242|Coffee beans are okay, but they clogged my Delonghi espresso machine. Will stick to lavazza beans.|0
243|243|I am comparing Peets Coffee with Dunkin Donut blend.  I like both of them.|1
244|244|I've liked t Peet's coffees in the past, but this is too acidic, it bothers my wife and frankly IO didn't like the taste. You don't know unless you try, but just not worth it just to jump start GERD.|0
245|245|Very good flavor, but I'm not used to dark roast.  It's thick!  But then I can use less for a pot of coffee.|1
246|246|The coffee is good but I am a little upset that I was sent a bag that was almost expired.|0
247|247|Not a bad cup of joe. It's not anything out of this world, but it's a satisfying cup of coffee.|1
248|248|I buy Peet's Major Dickason's all the time, usually at my local supermarket when it's on sale. This price was a little better than the store's sale price, and I didn't have to wait for a sale. This is great coffee.|1
249|249|Deep roasted flavor. The aroma just makes me want to dive into the bag - or get it as a perfume!!  My favorite coffee by far and I've tried just about every dark French roast around.|1
250|250|Someone told me this was better than Starbucks. No way.|0
251|251|Not great, average tasting. 3.5 Stars.|1
252|252|When I crave coffee in the late afternoon or evening this is my go to - It's the best tasting decaf I've ever had.  Kudos to Peets!  I served it to guests who immediately went to the Amazon site and ordered some for themselves.|1
253|253|Love Pete's.  Been drinking it for over 20 years.  I actually blend 70/30 with Italian and Decaf French.|1
254|254|This is a great blend that I will purchase in the future.. Gone are the days of ground up tin coffee for me, I'm officially a SNOB!!!|1
255|255|Really nice, full bodied coffee. Will continue to buy this brand.|1
256|256|A very interesting and unusual blend , and I suspect the only decaf version available . It is a bit on the stronger side , but an enjoyable brew.|1
257|257|Our most favorite all time coffee!!|1
258|258|this is my favorite coffee and it is hard to find in stores.|1
259|259|always my favorite!!!|1
260|260|I usually roast and grind my own coffee; Cafe Domingo is one of the very few exceptions.|1
261|261|Sookie,, this is coffee ☕|1
262|262|This is great tasting coffee. I would recommend it. However, now that it is available in the supermarkets, be sure you are not paying for shipping and compare prices. It might be cheaper in the brick and mortar store.|1
263|263|This is a superb tasting coffee bean, when ground right before a pour, it makes a heartfelt brew for the morning commute|1
264|264|I really like this coffee! I'm not a coffee snob, by any means, but undo enjoy a nice, smooth cup of coffee. This bag lasted me a little over a month, making one cup every day. With some coffees, I have to use more grounds than directed to get a strong enough flavor, but with Peet's if I use too much, it's actually too strong and bitter. Which is awesome!!|1
265|265|One of my favorites. Great flavor! Only problem I have is I tend to drink it too fast. It's that good.|1
266|266|Excellent coffee.  Smooth, full bodied.  Well rounded.  The monthly service option makes it easy to have Peets every morning!|1
267|267|This is great coffee and I love it.  So glad I can get it delivered.|1
268|268|Best ground coffee I have ever tasted!  My new favorite brand.|1
269|269|This is my favorite coffee. It's so flavorful. Nothing compares.|1
270|270|I would drink this again good breakfast coffee|1
271|271|Taste isn't as chocolatey as expected. But I am a huge fan of Peet's brand, nonetheless.|0
272|272|I'm not a big coffee aficionado, but I do love a good cup. I've tried only a few of the many brands and flavors out there, and I have a good sense of what I like and what I don't. Peet's Big Bag falls just south of the middle in my tastes. It's got a good flavor that can feel a bit heavy to my taste. I tend to like them a bit lighter, but not light. I flavored this like my usual favorites, a little milk, a little chocolate, and a little caramel. It tasted okay, but again, not quite good. The grounds are pretty stinky after brewing, which i hear isn't unusual, but I've never had this much trouble before. These grounds really stink after brewing, I was surprised coffee grounds could smell this bad.The coffee itself is okay, and again this will obviously come down to preference. For me, this isn't really my bag. Not awful, but I just can't bring myself to finish a full cup of this flavor.|0
273|273|Not a big fan of this coffee  OK but not buying again|0
274|274|Great strong coffee beans !|1
275|275|Who would have thought that decaf coffee could taste so good.  Love it!|1
276|276|Peet's is so much better than Starbucks overpriced coffee.  I hope Amazon can get their Holiday Blend soon.|1
277|277|Our favorite brand, more flavor than most brands out there!|1
278|278|No where near as full bodied as Starbucks. Very weak.|0
279|279|We mix some decaf with the regular Peet's|1
280|280|We perk this coffee blend and we love the smell and the rich taste.|1
281|281|Love this coffee. One of the best tasting dark roast decafs out there. I order it all the time.|1
282|282|Absolutely the best coffee I have ever brewed.|1
283|283|Mediocre at best. Will not reorder.|0
284|284|Good coffee, it's not powdery like Arabian coffee, a bit more grainy. It tastes good.|1
285|285|Real good coffee. It's like flipping the bird at Starbucks crap.|1
286|286|The richest decaf I have tried without bitterness|1
287|287|Love this coffee! Strong and flavorful without being bitter.|1
288|288|Excellent tasting coffee.|1
289|289|Love all Peets coffee.  Never bitter.|1
290|290|Brazil Minas Naturais. For a mainstream coffee, surprisingly rich and nuanced. With just the right amount of half and half - bold, creamy and robust...without the bitterness. I stocked up - when you find something you like at the right price, what's holding you back?|1
291|291|My wife lives on this stuff.  She orders it religiously.  She says I can highly recommend it.|1
292|292|I love Peet's coffee and this decaf version (hard to find) did not disappoint.|1
293|293|You need to manage shelf life or something, the peets coffee was stale , off flavor, very disappointed, buy product all the time in stores never this bad of quality . Bummed|0
294|294|Bought for the office.  LOVE this coffee.  We finally agree on a Peet's coffee.|1
295|295|Peets rivals other French or Italian roast decaf coffees for robust flavor.  We discovered it on vacation at an out-of-town supermarket, and were glad to find it on Amazon after we got home.  Make it with hot cocoa mix, and it beats Starbucks.|1
296|296|A great dark roast!|1
297|297|Excellent cup of coffee. Full bodied and very rich!|1
298|298|Really enjoy this flavor.  Good and strong too!!|1
299|299|"Strong, or ""bold"" as some may say. I like to drink my coffee black, but holy smokes Batman!"|0
300|300|Very good coffee|1
301|301|I love Peet’s coffee! The vendor sent ground coffee, I wanted WHOLE BEANS. THE PICTURE IN YOUR THE SATISFACTION SURVEY IS WHOLE BEANS.|0
302|302|Very good coffee, not to bold, but a medium roast, without a bite|1
303|303|Received today 26 feb 2018....freshest by date 15 feb 2018 ....not happy atall!|0
304|304|Great flavor, has the pick me up you expect from a good cup of joe|1
305|305|Delicious and water processed.|1
306|306|rich flavor, true to the Pete's brand. very satisfying cup of coffee.|1
307|307|Dude, its dirt cheap, and it tastes like it was just ground.|1
308|308|Gosh it's good coffee.|1
309|309|The item arrived on time and the flavor from this coffee is amazing!|1
310|310|great coffee.  Arrived quickly.|1
311|311|Love this coffee! So good|1
312|312|My favorite coffee. Has been for years.|1
313|313|Sorry! I do not like it. Bitter and burnt. Not smooth to my taste even with cream.|0
314|314|"I bought a Keurig Single Serve machine this past holiday season. Ever since I've been on a quest for checking out coffees, teas, k-cups vs Eko-Brew, chai mixes, etc. Whenever I obsess on a research project, I never quite end up where I thought I was going. K-Cups are ""nifty."" However, they ARE expensive and a huge impact on waste disposal. So, after testing out the make-your-own device that came with the machine, I also bought a couple of Eko-Brews (vastly prefer them). Since I'm supposed to limit my caffeine intake and this machine has tripled my consumption (it's still a toy,) I started testing out Decaf coffees. I really liked the San Francisco Bay Coffee Company's French Roast Decaf K-cups; however, they are STILL K-cups, even if much less expensive than Keurig brand-name/licensed products.So, based on others reviews, I've been testing out various offerings of 12-oz bags of French Roast Decaf. Peet's is definitely the winner so far; however, it IS more expensive. I will have to weigh the cost vs some perhaps minor differences that gives it favorite status over damned good! Without indulging in precise math, I calculate the average 8 oz cup of Peet's Joe as being around 25 cents when compared to K-cup per unit costs. Meanwhile the quest goes on. But for those who can detect subtle nuances and cost isn't all that big of a factor, I'd highly recommend trying very bold Decaf."|1
315|315|Awesome coffee!|1
316|316|Amazing aroma and delicious coffee!  Definitely recommend Peet's coffee!|1
317|317|Terrible de-caf. Will not buy again. Yuck!|0
318|318|Fantastic and delicious coffee! I definitely recommend Peet's brand of coffee.|1
319|319|This coffee bean is good for some smooth tasting Americano.Would appreciate a little bit more of texture|1
320|320|Great product, thank you|1
321|321|For medium, it was roasted to long. This is just me, I'm not an expert|0
322|322|yummy|1
323|323|Somewhat bitter-tasting. Prefer Major Dickason, which we find richly-flavored and mellow.|0
324|324|I give it a rating of B+/A-. It is a dark roast and I prefer dark roasts. It is worth trying, if like me, you want to experiment with ground coffee blends until you find a coffee you can give a A++ rating.|1
325|325|Delicious coffee!|1
326|326|my favorite coffee, hands down. Peets other coffee is fair, but this is worth the cost and is great perculated, or presssed.|1
327|327|Peet's is always good, never fail good cup of coffee. Rich and strong but smooth|1
328|328|Excellent coffee with a dark, full bodied taste without the caffeine|1
329|329|Solid, full body coffee. One of my new favorites.|1
330|330|Love the coffee, very strong.|1
331|331|Great coffee! Will order again.|1
332|332|I've been drinking Major Dickason's Peet's since 1992~!  Thankful it's still an option!!|1
333|333|Yummy, Rich, Flavorful.  Great coffee at a create price especially when you subscribe and save.|1
334|334|Peet's is my favorite, I like the roast aroma very much!|1
335|335|Coffee tastes good.  Beware that the product Is short dated..  Our coffee arrived 8/2 with a best by date of August 23rd.  Disappointed with the short date for the price.|0
336|336|All Petes coffee are excellent. Reason I gave this four stars is because I personally like a more robust blend like French roast but I wanted a decaf and thought I would try this one.  Anyone who drinks coffee would like this medium roast as it is very smooth.  P. S.  I love Major Dickasons.|1
337|337|Bought this for my mom and she loves it|1
338|338|Tried as a substitute for Major Dickason's  Bend.  NOT the same.  Ok but not great.|1
339|339|GOOD FLAVOR|1
340|340|Best coffee available|1
341|341|My favorite coffee. Strong, smooth taste. The best!|1
342|342|Can't go wrong with Peet's. Strong but smooth flavor.|1
343|343|Excellent coffee and it arrived quickly. It's really smooth for the boldness of the coffee, and it's CAFFEINE FREE! :-)|1
344|344|Great tasting coffee. Can't believe it's decaf!|1
345|345|Exactly as expected.|1
346|346|Peet's is the king of coffee grounds.|1
347|347|Not my cup of coffee too bitter.|0
348|348|Peets is one of my favorite, this one tastes great.|1
349|349|This is some pretty tasty stuff. I chug it every morning and find myself excited when I wake up, to have some more.|1
350|350|very Pleased with mu purchase|1
351|351|Paid $16 to receive ONE bag! Did not receive a pack of 2 as stated in the description.|0
352|352|Excellent smooth roast. Bold and clean.|1
353|353|Robust decaf|1
354|354|The coffee junkies I sent it to as a gift said it was really good!|1
355|355|If you like a medium-dark roast, these beans are a good purchase. Good flavor, overall happy with it.|1
356|356|I've tried many different types of coffee from Amazon and this one is in the top of my list|1
357|357|Good coffee. Be a Peets fan for a long time.|1
358|358|Great coffee, great price and speedy delivery as usual. I love this flavor of Peeta.|1
359|359|Smooth and flavorful|1
360|360|Awesome flavor for decaf. Fresh and robust.|1
361|361|Very smooth, and freshly roasted - my go-to coffee.|1
362|362|This coffee quality is very good. Maybe this is not the perfect solution for a french press though.|1
363|363|Very very stale!|0
364|364|Very good dark roast decaf at a reasonable price.|1
365|365|Delicious|1
366|366|Peets coffee is the best there is!|1
367|367|The best decaf coffee. Period. Every evening, a joy. And I do love my caffeine earlier in the day.|1
368|368|Starbucks who?Now this is great coffee.|1
369|369|Love this coffee when it’s fresh. This one was best by 02/11/2018; what’s up with that?|0
370|370|My wife loved this flavor of Peet's coffee.  I will purchase it again.|1
371|371|Coffee as it should be, in spite of being decaf.|1
372|372|Great great coffee. Rich, full body coffee taste, not washed out or flat. Delivered close to production date. Auto reorder feature is a great convenience but the price jumped 50% after second delivery. (brick & mortar prices never changed)|1
373|373|Because coffee!|1
374|374|Meh for Peets. Lil Bang for too much buck.|0
375|375|Great taste|1
376|376|excellent flavor given as a requested gift|1
377|377|Not bad, but not my favorite taste|1
378|378|Excellent !!  I ground Brazil Minas Naturais coffee beans for both the Mizudashi Coffee Pot, Cold Coffee Brewer; and for use in my drip coffeemaker.The taste is both bold and flavorful -- just the way I like it !!|1
379|379|Three of us in the house drink coffee and everyone likes the Peet's hot or iced.|1
380|380|The best decaf coffee I've found yet. Bold, flavorful, almost don't miss the caffeine. Excellent.|1
381|381|Delicious decaf!|1
382|382|I like this coffee a lot.|1
383|383|Simply delicious.|1
384|384|Simply the best coffee ever. It is strong but very smooth. Be forewarned that after this there's no going back to the coffees from that national chain that has a store on every city block.|1
385|385|One of the best dark roast coffees I've ever had. The nutty flavor balances out the boldness.|1
386|386|Shipped after the best before date.|0
387|387|If you like a spot of nice rich crema in your coffee then try Peet's Luminosa in the french press tradition at 200F for about 4-5 min - perfecto.  This is a very full flavored coffee and though it is classified as light brew by Peet's - it has a special bold flavor that only comes from a fine Columbian bean.  It has a wonderful taste and remains my base coffee for most days.  The only cup of coffee that comes close to this brew is the actual coffee I had the pleasure of drinking in Columbia.  Goes great with breakfast and food - blueberry muffins or croissants.  Peet's has lots of very fine coffee at reasonable prices - I would like to see Amazon carry more of Peet's brands for Prime customers.  Brewing this in a French press greatly improves the taste experience and wonderful smell that lingers awhile.|1
388|388|Peet's has become my favorite coffee. Wonderful taste. I purchased the dash button, which is very handy. Very happy with my purchase.|1
389|389|Great coffee|1
390|390|Best tasting coffee yet!!|1
391|391|the taste is amazing|1
392|392|Great flavor,one of the best I've ever had.|1
393|393|Good quality coffee.|1
394|394|Wonderful coffee.  A bit pricey, but I am worth it!|1
395|395|Came smelling rancid and with holes punctured in the packaging. Couldn’t return it.|0
396|396|Love that Peet’s coffee|1
397|397|I ordered this because my husband loves coffee. He says it taste like any other regular coffee, so unfortunately, I won't be ordering it again. It smells great. Arrived quickly.|0
398|398|Husband wasn’t a huge fan of this coffee|0
399|399|Will try Peets other coffees|1
400|400|like the rich fresh flavor|1
401|401|Itry almost every coffee from another country. But this not have a good flavor for me.|0
402|402|Im very picky with coffee, this one tastes great and the price is good.|1
403|403|Peets makes incredible decaf.|1
404|404|This is a great dark roast bean!|1
405|405|"We have purchased several times, and always been satisfied however most recently (NOV 30) we had a similar experience as other where the ""best by"" date was a mere three weeks out for BOTH BAGS (we just don't drink it that fast!) ALSO ONE (not both) of the bags smelled ... off... the coffee tasted fine, but was not as strong as usual and you didn't get a good aroma when the bag was opened. We are hoping this was a one-off issue, and will receive another shipment - but if these problems occur again, we will find out coffee elsewhere. EDITED TO ADD: my purchase price on autoship has increased $2 this month... with no alert or explanation. :("|0
406|406|Strong flavor and too bitter.|0
407|407|Like Peet's. Fine grind and makes a nice cup of coffee. Needed a small bag to take on a business trip. Never like the hotel coffee so I take my own.|1
408|408|Always outstanding.  Don't even know it's decaf|1
409|409|Very delicious. However the grind is too fine for me to use in my refillable K-cup. I can only make this coffee in my stove-top espresso pot.|1
410|410|Lovely coffee!|1
411|411|Very hard to find bold caffeine free coffee. Great bold taste!|1
412|412|Husbands favorite over Dunkin and Starbucks|1
413|413|Best light roast coffee I have tasted so far! The smell is divine and the taste isn’t bitter at all unlike a lot of coffee brands. I have ordered many times and have always gotten fresh bags.|1
414|414|Usually I love this blend.  The one I received was received 68 days past the freshest by date.|0
415|415|I drink a lot of coffee. It is my favorite beverage. I purchased some Peets Coffee because I saw it on sale. I was very impressed, smooth, rich and not bitter. Excellent everyday coffee. Love it.|1
416|416|Fresh and perfectly roasted. This is my favorite morning coffee.|1
417|417|Good coffee, not great for cold brew, to finely ground.|1
418|418|It had already expired!!|0
419|419|Not bad. Beans are better than grounds if you have the tool to grind it.|1
420|420|This is my favorite decaf coffee! Flavor taste much better than other decaf's- I m opinion|1
421|421|christmas gift|1
422|422|Love the taste|1
423|423|Thanks great as per usual.|1
424|424|Best everyday espresso beans out there|1
425|425|not a great taste|0
426|426|Great Coffee! Bold, but not bitter. I love Peet’s Coffee, can’t go wrong.|1
427|427|Delicious coffee!  The auto delivery works well for me|1
428|428|Strong stuff.  Got the innerd's movin'.|1
429|429|Taste great|1
430|430|Pretty decent.|1
431|431|This is the only coffee we buy anymore, since it is not always available in our small town we purchase through Amazon..I love Amazon|1
432|432|You can't beat Peet's Coffee!|1
433|433|Favorite Decaf coffee|1
434|434|It was tasty coffee.  I was hoping for a little more chocolate flavor to come through, but it was good even without it.|1
435|435|This is my favorite coffee, rich, smooth and just that hint of cocoa I like.|1
436|436|This has become my go to coffee.  Bold but not bitter.  Not as overpowered as most Starbucks coffees.|1
437|437|Great tasting coffee|1
438|438|So much better than Starbucks and at a great price. It's got such great aroma too.|1
439|439|Got this for around $5 and it's great for espresso.|1
440|440|my favorite coffee|1
441|441|my favorite coffee. Great smell, great flavor if you like dark roast. You cannot go wrong with Peet's Coffee.|1
442|442|If you like a bold coffee as I do, you may love this brand.|1
443|443|Smooth coffee, I buy this because of the dash button!|1
444|444|Peets is the best and this blend is wonderful dark , will order again|1
445|445|Good taste! Great Flavor!|1
446|446|Good coffee.|1
447|447|One of my very favorite coffee's I can snag on Amazon for a good price. This brew is rich and full bodied, mixes perfectly with brown sugar to deliver a rich morning treat.|1
448|448|Very rich taste.  Will buy again!|1
449|449|Rich and smooth flavor .|1
450|450|Fresh just like store but without the drive, and store always out of stock... Bravo|1
451|451|Fantastic! Rich! Love it!|1
452|452|normally i go for major dickasons blend, but this was all that was available. it came tightly packed, and it tasted great. i'll buy it again.|1
453|453|Very mild|1
454|454|Peets rules! Great coffee. I've used many varieties--all top notch.|1
455|455|Great Coffee when I used with Krups fully auto machine which I bought from Amazon too.|1
456|456|pretty good coffee, I'd buy it again|1
457|457|BEST coffee ever!! Especially when made in a peculator!!|1
458|458|favorite blend. bold, rich. best tasting decaf I've found.|1
459|459|Very strong, love it.|1
460|460|I love this coffee.  However, all of a sudden it went up by over $5 a pound????  And it says it's discontinued, but no, it's not.|0
461|461|It's very good decaf coffee.  Has a great coffee flavor.|1
462|462|This make a great cup, Peet's is superior in Decaf|1
463|463|This Italian roast coffee from Peet's is my favorite but stores near me no longer carry it.|1
464|464|Cheaper than at my local grocery store. I really enjoyed the French Roast. Italian toast.. not so much.|1
465|465|I've tried many brands - this is my favorite.|1
466|466|This is my go to coffee, I have been drinking it for years and I love it.|1
467|467|Best smooth coffee!|1
468|468|Love It...Yummy!!!|1
469|469|Love this coffee! I always buy this or Peet's house blend. Both have excellent flavor!|1
470|470|this is some good coffee  do like :)|1
471|471|If you like strong flavors, then this is great. A little to strong/bold for my liking.|0
472|472|Smooth- after watching the TV show America's Test Kitchens I ordered this coffee.Not bitter and definitely something I would order again.|1
473|473|Awesome coffee|1
474|474|Love this blend and the price!|1
475|475|An excellent coffee. If you enjoy a smooth but light, not too light, coffee this is for you.|1
476|476|Yummy!  So hard to find a dark roast decaf.  Love this one.|1
477|477|Excellent coffee and very fresh!|1
478|478|Really great coffee. Like the other flavors of Peet's it has a pleasant taste.|1
479|479|Can never go wrong with Peet's Coffee.|1
480|480|I LOVE THIS COFFEE!!!! Can't drink anything else. I love that amazon has a great price on this 12 oz bag that beats my local supermarket|1
481|481|Received this coffee and it is currently December 16th and only good until the 31st....|0
482|482|Good stuff.|1
483|483|So good and perfect for a monthly subscription!|1
484|484|Fantastic!  Grings well and brews an excellent cup if coffee.|1
485|485|Taste's great! Love the bold flavor!|1
486|486|Only decaf with a super rich flavor. Will drink no other!|1
487|487|Smooth dark roast with a little chocolate taste in there.  I use it for espresso and everyday coffee.|1
488|488|My favorite coffee, rich and so flavorful.|1
489|489|I ordered this decaf by mistake! but I found the flavor is better than the coffee Ive been buying at the grocery store. Good stuff|1
490|490|Peets coffee is hands down our favorite. Strong rich taste with no hint of bitterness commonly found in another major brand. We don’t buy any other kind.|1
491|491|My favorite morning brew|1
492|492|It was good, but I think the bag of coffee was a bit old|1
493|493|Cant find dark roast decaf in my area.  Great bold taste!|1
494|494|Tasty coffee at a reasonable price.|1
495|495|Great coffee.|1
496|496|Superb cup of coffee!|1
497|497|One of my favorite blends!!|1
498|498|This coffee is the best.|1
499|499|Best flavor of the Brand. Great price on Subscribe versus putchasing at local store|1
500|500|Big, bold flavor with chocolate notes.  Love it!|1
501|501|Great coffee will buy again!|1
502|502|This coffee us just okay. Nothing special. Definitely not strong enough for me.|0
503|503|Peets coffee is always the best, especially at this price.  I received a 16 oz package which usually costs around $14, so I was extremely pleased.|1
504|504|We ground this down to espresso powder and tried using a similar volume as coarse ground coffee and it was the blandest coffee we've had since going to the local greasy spoon diner.|0
505|505|One of the best available coffees.|1
506|506|Best dark roast decaf coffee.  Bold but not bitter. I buy from Amazon because cannot always find at local grocery store. Advantage to online purchase is super fresh grind, less than 1 month.|1
507|507|Fine ground, deep roast, really good ground coffee.  Great in a french press, although a bit finely ground.  Watch out for that last sip in the bottom of your mug.|1
508|508|Absolutely killer|1
509|509|light roast and full flavor.|1
510|510|a great gift|1
511|511|GREAT decaf. I love my coffee, but had to reduce my caffeine intake. Highly recommend this one! Nearly tastes like regular javaaaaaaaah.|1
512|512|It tastes really well.|1
513|513|a little strong but good flavor|1
514|514|The first bag I got was fantastic.  But I've gotten several since and it seems the quality changes through out the year.  The taste of coffee does vary a lot but its too expensive to pay for when the taste is poor.|0
515|515|Great dark roast coffee. Great price. Thanks.|1
516|516|Very bitter in taste. Not even close to the product description  Had high expectations for this brand. I thought it would be better than Starbucks Expresso beans. Starbucks has a much better crema and taste.|0
517|517|Great taste!|1
518|518|Delicious.|1
519|519|Strong. Smooth. Delicious.|1
520|520|Interesting. I always got a strong reaction from caffeine and could actually feel the jolt when it clicked in with heart racing awareness. I ordered the decaf Major Dickason and got the same reaction. Maybe it was mismarked or packaged wrong??? Not sure, but either way I will leave this for my husband who gets no adverse reactions from this coffee or caffeine. I had used the house blend decaf K cups but they were out of them this month so I thought I would give this flavor a try. Oh well. I guess you can't win them all. I'll use my Barista Italian decaf K cups and Tully's French roast decaf until my regular house blend decaf K cups come in on S&S hopefully next month. BTW, I did find this on the weak side though without much flavor at all which left the caffeine click even more puzzling.|0
521|521|My husband buys this and rebuys it.  I think that means he loves it.|1
522|522|This is the only coffee we will order|1
523|523|Really like the taste of this coffee|1
524|524|Great coffee|1
525|525|This is amazing strong bold coffee. Great taste and flavor. I'll buy again.|1
526|526|best coffee ever, but seems like it's not as fresh as when you buy it straight from the Co. itself.|1
527|527|My favorite from Peet's is San Sebastian, but I wanted to mix it up. I wish I had realized this coffee was already ground, but it was barely a week since the roast date so no worry. It's a very dfferent blend, complex but mild. I had to add more grounds to reach a good strength. It almost has a floral/fruity characteristic to it. Definitely worth buying once and I may buy again on occasion, but San Sebastian remains my go-to.|1
528|528|Best DARK and RICH coffee with a robust flavor!|1
529|529|This is really great coffee. It is the only decaf my wife and I can both agree on as a perfect cup of decaf coffee. I just wish Amazon would offer a standardized, repeatable price. I put it on their repeat-order system for delivery of 4 bags every month, only to see the price more than double a few days later w/o notification to me. So I canceled the repeat order, only to see the price drop to almost what I had paid, the very next day. Automatic reorders call for a standardized, agreed price that doesn't fluctuate so much. But I am not docking the product itself any stars for that. Major Dickason's Decaf is an excellent decaf - full bodied, good taste, nice and dark, very satisfying. Nowadays I just wait for the lower price and load up with 8 or 10 bags at a time. It stays reasonably fresh for a solid two months. Great stuff|1
530|530|on time and as described|1
531|531|Best at home drip coffee!|1
532|532|Very delicious.|1
533|533|Good dark roast coffee|1
534|534|If you are looking for some good strong coffee this is it!  Deep roasted and full bodied, I had to add some creamer actually.  A great morning coffee..just opening the bag to get the beans will light you up|1
535|535|Perfect selection......always buy.|1
536|536|One of the best blends from Peets. I like dark roasts generally, and I enjoy the unique flavor of this one. I like Garuda nearly as much, but it's rarely available.|1
537|537|I personally didn't like the flavor. Sorry|0
538|538|Love it!! SERIOUSLY FRESH!!|1
539|539|Excellent coffee!|1
540|540|I love this coffee however you can find it cheaper elsewhere|1
541|541|This is very good decaf coffee.|1
542|542|Ilivedinthebayareaover20years. Enjoyedpeetsmanytimes.|1
543|543|This is some of the best coffee I have ever had. I'm a bit of a coffee snob. I refuse to drink instant.I buy whole bean and grind only a scoop at a time when I'm ready to brew.Peet's coffee has not disappointed me.|1
544|544|Great flavor  and good quality from Peets|1
545|545|i would definitely recommend it even better to use in a french press.|1
546|546|Strong dark roast coffee.|1
547|547|Best decaf on the market|1
548|548|Housebound and loving my favorite of many years.|1
549|549|I can only drink decaf, so I appreciate this rich, full-bodied and flavorful change from the typical house blend or French roast, which is okay, but you can tire of drinking only that kind.  Major Dickason's decaf is no longer available locally in markets here, so I'm glad it is available online.|1
550|550|It has a very bitter after taste.  I figure I would give them a try and was very disappointed.|0
551|551|Really good coffee...hope it will be available again|1
552|552|Love Petes Coffee. I will buy this when I run out.|1
553|553|I recently stopped drinking regular coffee, (wanted to cut back on caffeine) this blend is sooooo tasty. Best decaf I've ever had.|1
554|554|warning...best by date...expired...not fresh|0
555|555|Yummm  best coffee ever|1
556|556|A good blend for those who like strong dark coffee at a good price point.|1
557|557|Good dark roast taste. Very happy|1
558|558|I love the flavor|1
559|559|For a dark roast coffee, the flavor was weak. I wouldn't order it again|0
560|560|Kinda had a weird aftertaste.  I cancelled my subscription|0
561|561|One of the best coffee's I have ever had.|1
562|562|Rich flavor without any bitterness! The best we've had since Millstone stopped making Mayan Black Onyx!|1
563|563|Great Coffee!|1
564|564|Purchased after tried at the coffee shop. Like the taste. :)|1
565|565|Delicious!! Especially for decaf. Deeply flavorful but not bitter.|1
566|566|was 5/31 a bad batch? I've gotten these before and they were awesome, but this time.... the smell made me nauseous.|0
567|567|Very good aroma and taste. I ordered it again|1
568|568|Good taste. Just really small for the prices. Local Costco is carrying the bigger bag for about the same price.|1
569|569|I tried this coffee based on a recommendation from a friend, who happens to love Starbucks.  I'm not a big fan of Starbucks since I find their coffee too dark and the beans taste burnt.  However, if you're into that sort of taste, then this is the coffee for you.|0
570|570|I like the coffee a lot. My only complaint is that I can't get it with whole beans through Amazon.|1
571|571|Well done Pete. Another great bag of coffee.|1
572|572|Great nice rich flavor|1
573|573|I have been trying many different coffees in search of something I like and my wife likes. I have trie a few different Pete's and up until this one I was not a fan of any. I try to buy whole bean and grind with a burr grinder before each use. I gave this a chance even though it was already ground. I though what the heck I wasn't expecting too much anyway. I was really surprised to find I loved it. My wife likes it also. I tend to put a bit too much coffee i when I brew( or so my wife says). With this coffee no complaints about it being strong and yet at the same time I have no complaints about it being too weak. Harmony in a cup.|1
574|574|Too dark for espresso tastes burnt but beans were not tippy burnt.|0
575|575|Love this coffee|1
576|576|A fine product|1
577|577|LOVE this coffee|1
578|578|Peet's Coffee is my favorite coffee & Amazon has the best delivery.|1
579|579|"Love this coffee so much my husband also bad seen it by on his order so we ended up with 2. Only downfall is that it's considered an ""add-on"" to an order shipping from an Amazon order not a 3rd party."|1
580|580|This is by far the best tasting of all the Peet's flavors I've tried. Really very good as french press.|1
581|581|Love this coffee.  Strong and floor packed and not bitter at all. Perfection.  Great deal with subscribe and save!|1
582|582|Peet’s Italian Roast whole bean is my favorite coffee! I get three bags a month but I’ll be changing it to four. It’s bold taste. Not bitter.|1
583|583|My favorite affordable blend!|1
584|584|Tastes very good. Much better than most coffee, even regular!|1
585|585|Smooth taste|0
586|586|Not bad but not really my flavor. I prefer a regular flavor.|0
587|587|I’ve been searching for a deep, smooth flavored decaf coffee and I finally found a winner! Best decaf roast I’ve tried and I will definitely order again.|1
588|588|Problem one:The beans smell potent in a burnt way. The pleasant flavor I typically find with my french press is lost on these beans. Even with cream, which I typically don't use, this coffee reminds me of terrible drip coffee I have had elsewhere.Problem two:Also, the beans were prepared in mid-Sept, I recieved in late Nov, and the best by date is less than a month away. For some that may not matter, but I don't have coffee all that often, and I shudder to think the taste could get worse.Suggestion:This coffee was great: https://www.amazon.com/Caribou-Coffee-Mahogany-Whole-Roast/dp/B00H345GT6?th=1I've also tried a cheaper african blend that was decent, and far superior to this coffee.|0
589|589|Love this coffee|1
590|590|Very good. Very quick. Thank you.|1
591|591|Very good tastey. I’m always drink is coffee.|1
592|592|Good coffee. I've never ordered better on line.|1
593|593|Not much mocha flavor and very very smooth love it wish it was less expensive|1
594|594|"My friend just got an espresso machine and we have tried three different brands of beans. Peets blows the other two out of the water. I just wish it wasn't an Amazon Prime ""add on"" item so I could order it by itself. Peets it my brand!"|1
595|595|This has become my favorite coffee|1
596|596|Some of the best tasting coffee out there!|1
597|597|It came to my door in 2 days.  Peet's coffee is the best.|1
598|598|This is my favorite coffee. Usually buy this to grid but was traveling and needed a preg-round fix for the RV|1
599|599|Rich flavor.|1
600|600|delicious|1
601|601|This is our favorite coffee. It has a dark, rich but not bitter flavor. This is the cheapest price I've seen for it.|1
602|602|This is the one for me.|1
603|603|Excellent strong, bold coffee for a decaf|1
604|604|Delicious! Not planning on changing my brand anytime soon!|1
605|605|Makes a tasty 24 hour cold brew|1
606|606|Not the freshest roast. About the same price as in the neighborhood supermarket.|0
607|607|Great quality of coffee, reasonable price, fast free shipping|1
608|608|I like this brand and I've been awake for days......|1
609|609|i ordered at june, but when i received the coffee bean it's roasted at April and the recommended date for the fresh taste is July, which had been almost passed|0
610|610|The best dark blend of Decaf coffee on the market.|1
611|611|My new favorite coffee!!!|1
612|612|I love Peet's Mocca Java decaf. I do not appreciate receiving two 12 oz bags of coffee that were roasted 3 months ago. I have to use them up in one month for them to remain fresher to brew.|0
613|613|Tried this coffee recommended by friend. Actually love this major dickenson blend. Bold flavor also aroma is awesome|1
614|614|French Roast decaf doesn't taste like decaf at all, nice and Rick and dark. My favorite|1
615|615|Excellent flavor ,not too light .|1
616|616|Excellent as always|1
617|617|Just like the supermarket...but cheaper! Will definitely buy again!|1
618|618|Great  coffee. Delicious cold brewed and black. No cream or sugar needed.|1
619|619|Excellant coffee with the added convenience of a subscription.|1
620|620|Not too dark, not too light. Very well balanced. My favorite coffee ever.|1
621|621|Excellent coffee. Smooth, rich love the flivor|1
622|622|Sooo good.|1
623|623|My favorite. Offee|1
624|624|its deliciously dark|1
625|625|Great for any kind of drip coffee. Makes good French press but not the best I've had.|1
626|626|A morning delight|1
627|627|A great American Classic. Good folks who know and love finding your favorite brew and set to supply you.|1
628|628|I would say it is equivalent to Starbucks house blend. Maybe even a little better taste.|1
629|629|We've bought this coffee a couple times now and love the flavor.  A very rich, full bodied coffee without any bitter notes.|1
630|630|Love my Peet's coffee!|1
631|631|Fantastic cup of coffee|1
632|632|Great stuff.  I'm a coffee snob and this makes a nice cup.|1
633|633|Nice flavorpackaged well|1
634|634|Some of the best tasting readily available coffee I have had. Blows Starbucks out of the water. Not that I like Starbucks at all, but due to its popularity, it seems to serve as a fairly good benchmark.I absolutely detest light roasted coffee; dark roast all the way for me, and this doesn't disappoint.|1
635|635|My favorite|1
636|636|Peet's is the BEST coffee!|1
637|637|excellent|1
638|638|It's Peet's classic flavor. Better than Starbuck's!|1
639|639|I love this particular coffee.  Very strong coffee.|1
640|640|delicious coffee|1
641|641|Good quality and price.|1
642|642|Always Peets|1
643|643|I've had Peet's coffee before and loved it. For some reason this version is very bitter. I will go with the lighter roasts from now on.|0
644|644|Excellent.|1
645|645|Love this coffee!|1
646|646|Rich, dark, full flavored with no bitterness. What I liked least about it? Is I cannot now that I have discovered it, get anymore through Amazon.|1
647|647|Love it...|1
648|648|Great coffee... Very smooth|1
649|649|I bought this coffee because it was mentioned in a Coffee maker test by America's Test Kitchen.  My wife and I decided to see how the other half lives with higher quality coffee.  I agree that it tastes great.  I can't afford the price.  For the record, we settled on 8 o'clock 100% Colombian.|1
650|650|I received this coffee on March 29.  Package reads “freshest by 02/17/18.  One star from me.|0
651|651|Peet's is the best!|1
652|652|Great coffee drink! I like the smell and taste!|1
653|653|A great flavor and a good price.|1
654|654|best coffee ever!|1
655|655|It's hard to find a decaf dark roast. This coffee is very flavorful.|1
656|656|This is a rich, incredibly flavorful coffee!  That's why I have it delivered every month!|1
657|657|I give it an B+/A- grade. I would order it again.|1
658|658|My new best coffee!|1
659|659|Excellent coffee|1
660|660|Nice strong taste|1
661|661|The best, most robust tasting Decaf coffee ever!|1
662|662|Best coffe i have found in 2 years|1
663|663|Face flavor!!|1
664|664|Great flavor, I wish that larger bags was available.|1
665|665|love this coffee..so does the family|1
666|666|love the coffee, came with best fresh by date of yesterday....annoying|0
667|667|yummy! Peet's is good!|1
668|668|Terrible, bitter taste.  Product was sold out of date.  What a rip off.  I'm never buying Peet's coffee again.|0
669|669|Delicious|1
670|670|This is my favorite coffee. Get one every month.|1
671|671|Good coffee.|1
672|672|I love the rich taste of this coffee. It has a good roasted taste, but is not bitter and doesn't taste burnt (some roasted versions do). Paired with plain half and half and a cup of this tastes very gourmet. First fell in love with Peet's during a visit with relatives in Cali, and now I can have access to it via Amazon.|1
673|673|Wonderful, fruity coffee. I have been buying different roasts of Starbucks and Caraboo coffee for my home espresso maker. When I ran out of coffee, I decided to shop on Amazon. I had never tried Peets coffee before, so I thought to give it a try. I was not dissaponited! The coffee is fresh (they give you the roasting date on the package), and it has been making great lattes. The price is compatible with other packaged ground coffee (such as Starbucks and Caraboo), but the freshness makes all the difference. I recommend this brand and blend for a great cup of home made espresso!|1
674|674|My favorite coffee!!! Will always pick Peet's French Roast over anything else!|1
675|675|Had never tried this blend before. It's fantastic!  My new favorite! Very strong bold coffee just like I like!|1
676|676|My husband really loves Peet's Coffee, so I bought him a bag of the Major Dickason's. He was very impressed. He says its one of his favorites now.|1
677|677|"The problem is not with Peet's Major Dickason's coffee, but the one I got was roasted a month ago. Luckily, the coffee is great is begin with and doesn't officially ""expire"" until December, but freshness counts with coffee and this is not fresh. This means the coffee could have been even better if it was fresher...That's why I order Peet's.In all fairness, they refunded me without question, so if you'd like some nice, not-so-fresh Peet's coffee for free, you may want to gamble and see if they make the same mistake with you."|0
678|678|Rich and robust coffee.  Full of flavor.|1
679|679|Delicious coffee! We use this for our french press and it has been awesome!!|1
680|680|As a Berkeley native, it's hard to beat Peet's.|1
681|681|Great decaf blend. I can't even tell it's decaf.|1
682|682|Wonderful flavor! Decaf that tastes great.|1
683|683|Great morning wake up call. Dark, rich and robust  tasting coffee...even the brewing aroma perks up the energy levels. Definitely gets an ahhh...out of me.  ENJOY!!!|1
684|684|I love this coffee! Wonderful flavor and balance. It's very smooth, and not bitter.|1
685|685|Fanatastic taste! Not too little and not too much the way a cup of coffee should be!|1
686|686|Great coffee, have used it for years.|1
687|687|Excellent brand... Great flavor!!|1
688|688|Was not impressed by flavor. Decided to stick Caribou Decaf.|0
689|689|I love this coffee. It comes still fresh because the packaging is so great.|1
690|690|Smooth not bitter|1
691|691|It is good coffee|1
692|692|The taste is Great and when they get you liking the coffee, they raise the price to reorder.|1
693|693|"Very nice flavor... dark & strong. But it is ground finer than other ""drip"" grinds so it does not work well in our refillable K-Cups."|0
694|694|I am a coffee lover. I have tried various brands of coffee and Peets is definitely my favorite.|1
695|695|good bold coffee, price a little high- but when you are foggy in the noggin in the morning, it is a good first cup.|1
696|696|tastes like burnt coal|0
697|697|I liked its taste.|1
698|698|Peetes coffee is amazing! Bought it for my parents that live far away, they loved it!!!!!|1
699|699|Great tasting- I would've never guessed that this is decaf!|1
700|700|Great Coffee|1
701|701|This coffee is delicious!  It’s bold.|1
702|702|I fell in love with Peet's Major Dickason's Blend when I received a sampler 4 pack of the k-cups but since I can't get enough of the rich, full bodied blend I soon realized that it was much more econonmical to purchase by the bag already ground (or whole bean depending on availability) and add to reusable k-cups.  The aroma alone wakes me right up but the flavor is so delicious that it even managed to convert hubby into a coffee-a-holic.  I've tried their other blends, and while they are all good, Major Dickason's is my go to for giving me the caffeine jolt I need to get thru my long days in a smooth yet distinct flavorful blend that tastes far better than any I've gotten at a coffee house.|1
703|703|Coffee is great tasting.|1
704|704|Great taste|1
705|705|Love Peet's coffee, but we are continuing to receive coffee best used by November 2017. It is March 2018, and this has happened for the past few shipments.|0
706|706|This is the only coffee my roommate and I can agree we both love! Such a good flavorful medium roast coffee, I get it delivered monthly! Highly recommend.|1
707|707|Excellent smooth taste|1
708|708|Exactly what I wanted! My coffee of choice!|1
709|709|love it|1
710|710|New favorite flavor from Peet's.|1
711|711|Performs as expected.|1
712|712|The bag I received was already expired. I received the order on 12/19/17 and the fresh by date was 12/17/17. So it was shipped on the date it was no longer considered fresh.|0
713|713|If you like real, coffehouse style coffee, this is the best decaf I have found.  Not too much French Roast type darkness.  A medium, rich wonderful roast.  Hard to find, though.  Hence, order here!|1
714|714|Decent coffee.|0
715|715|"I drink decaffeinated coffee and Peet's tastes like the ""real"" thing.  It's hard for me to find it in my neighborhood so I'm happy to purchase it online.  It's always very fresh!"|1
716|716|For starters, I'm a huge Peet's fan.  I've purchased this blend at a Peet's shop, in a grocery store, and elsewhere in the past and really liked it.  The package Amazon sent me must have been old stock or something else, because it was bitter, like old beans that have gone South.  WAY South... I sometimes wonder about the Pantry items: are we getting the old stuff that never sold or the freshest?  Dunno, but from now on, I'll buy my Peet's at a Peet's.  When it's fresh, it makes a fabulous Toddy T2N Cold Brew System.|0
717|717|Great coffee.  Fast delivery.|1
718|718|best cup of decaf Java.|1
719|719|Excellent taste. Not weak and washed out like so many decaf blends.|1
720|720|my fave coffee!|1
721|721|I have it arrive on regular schedule, which is fabulous.  It's my favorite flavor of any kind of coffee.|1
722|722|For 12-ounces of ground coffee at this price, its already a deal.  Now when talking about flavor, I just happen to like Peet’s coffee better than others.  Sure, Starbucks has some ‘very good’ coffees but this one brand just tastes better – just my opinion.  The flavor is deeply rich, and full bodied.  There is no watery-flavored essence in this brand.  Everyone has their favorite, so I would just suggest you try this Dark Roast brand.  I use it specifically by the one-two cups in my French Press Coffee Maker.  That way I don’t waste any and if I have company I can make as much as I want.  No messing with a coffee machine.|1
723|723|Great coffee, good price and free Prime shipping when buying 3. Can’t go wrong.|1
724|724|can't live without it~!|1
725|725|i have had coffee all over the world.  this one of my fav.|1
726|726|great coffee, too expensive with Amazon though.|1
727|727|Love this coffee it's perfect very flavorful and smooth.|1
728|728|Good coffee that can usually be found at a good price.|1
729|729|very good product|1
730|730|great flavor|1
731|731|Always wonderful!|1
732|732|Come on now is there any other coffee in the world?|1
733|733|Worst coffee I've ever tasted. Bitter. I dont recommend.|0
734|734|Our favorite coffee.|1
735|735|Really good value, and gorgeous taste. I can only recommend for you guys.|1
736|736|This is the BEST coffee I have ever had, need more ...|1
737|737|Good coffe|1
738|738|greta coffee|1
739|739|This is my favorite blend but difficult to find.|1
740|740|Wonderful dark roast taste and not real bitter.  Good price compated to store and has a rost date on the package.  Great coffee.|1
741|741|A really great decaf.  If you didn't know it, you would believe it was regular and bold.|1
742|742|Good, but not great. Slightly bitter finish, but would buy again if the price was right.|1
743|743|WAY too acidic for me, which is uncommon for dark roasts.  The taste is very good, but the burn in my belly is not.|0
744|744|Wonderful, rich flavor, would order again.|1
745|745|like it's taste and flavor. A little pricey.|1
746|746|Very tasty for domestic coffee.|1
747|747|I like this variety from Peet's.  not the norm, and relatively light tasting roast.|1
748|748|No noticeable taste improvement over Folgers..especially the Black Silk variety is what I’m comparing to.|0
749|749|Freshly roasted coffee beans. Personally, I feel it is better than those on shelf ones from Publix or Target.|1
750|750|The coffee we have received from Petes in the past was great, especially the central and south american varieties.  This product has a bitterness that tweaks the nose and leaves an unpleasant after-taste.  If your a fan of bitter, sour tasting coffee, then you may appreciate it.  We like mellow, nutty, low acid types.  We use a burr grinder, pressure steep and specific water temp.  Not coffee snobs, just like good coffee and consistency.Again, if you like bitter dark chocolate, and lean to the African beans, this blend may work for you.|0
751|751|Marvelous coffee, but a $5 price increase will send me back to searching.|1
752|752|He loves it|1
753|753|I so wish the price had not gone up on this brand, my very favourite.|1
754|754|Good product.  Fast delivery.|1
755|755|Peets is the best coffee ever!|1
756|756|Love me some good Peet's coffee - what more can I say!|1
757|757|I love Peet's ice coffee.  As it turns out, I don't like the stuff that is brewed at home as much. Perhaps it's just this blend, but for me, it was more bitter than I like.|0
758|758|Good tasting coffee but a bit expensive for such a small amount in the bag.  Liked the idea od getting it once a month.|1
759|759|Delicious!!!!!|1
760|760|Great flavor, not acidic, smooth.|1
761|761|Great and on time|1
762|762|This is the best coffee on earth!!!|1
763|763|Delicious dark coffee with nice body.  Finding decaf and dark roast can b difficult. This fits the bill nicely, providing the flavor I need without the caffeine.|1
764|764|I personally prefer Major Dickason's blend by Peet's, but the French Roast is pretty good.  It is comparable to Starbuck's French roast.|1
765|765|I’m a coffee lover and this is one of the ones that I love the most|1
766|766|Sweet with caramel notes. Good coffee. Only downside is its not freshly ground. Fair price as well. A bit cheaper would put this over the top!|1
767|767|This is an excellent tasting coffee even though it is decaffeinated.|1
768|768|Didn't try this but package came damaged.  One star is for the product arriving damaged.  Also I only had 1 month to consume this product as the expiration date was 1 month from the date I received it.  Would be helpful to let us know what the expiration date of perishable products are going forward.  Or there should be a best practice in the warehouse to donate or throw out all products that are within 1 month of its expiration date.|0
769|769|great coffee, great price|1
770|770|tasty for decaf|1
771|771|Love the taste of this coffee. It is a very fine grind.  Almost a powder.|1
772|772|i prefer a dark roast. i just did not like the taste of this one.|0
773|773|Coffee tastes amazing!|1
774|774|Love it!|1
775|775|Ordered in December and was roasted in September.|0
776|776|Good coffee and good price.|1
777|777|good strong coffee will buy more|1
778|778|We have a top of the line esspresso machine residing in our kitchen and the Italian Roast is a great way to start off the day.|1
779|779|Excellent coffee; and it costs less than what I pay at the supermarket.|1
780|780|Very Bitter. Does not taste like advertised.  Would not buy again.|0
781|781|love the taste, exactly like the one I tasted at peets|1

794|794|Tastes wonderful|1
795|795|Good brand. Always good|1
796|796|Love it|1
797|797|This is strong coffee similar to Starbucks which I like. The price was right, so I decided to take it for a test drive.|1
798|798|Flavorful & delicious!|1
799|799|Love Peet's Coffee!!!!|1
800|800|I love it.|1
801|801|Great coffee and price!|1
802|802|Good taste.|1
803|803|"very very difficult to find but worth the wait. This wonderful coffee ""fits"" our Jura coffee maker and our tastes to perfection.Wish we could order more."|1
804|804|Very good coffee!|1
805|805|A great decaf coffee if you like a rich, hearty brew without caffeine.|1
806|806|I am serving in Afghanistan and ordered this product as an add on item on May 31, 2017 by June 7, 2017 I had the product. Taste great and very efficient on delivery.|1
807|807|Reliably delicious - Peets is an old favorite.|1
808|808|Love Peet's Big Bang, will buy more when it's on sale again|1
809|809|My favorite coffee!|1
810|810|Great coffee at my doorstep.|1
811|811|Peet's is the best.  This is a yummy coffee.|1
812|812|Pretty good coffee.  It has a mild flavor, not as bitter or strong as some of Peet's other blends.  It has a good chocolate flavor to it, although I add chocolate to my coffee anyway, so not sure how much of that is the coffee, but my mocha cappuccino still tasted good.  I also like how the grind is a bit on the finer side (not espresso grind) as I have a semi-automatic espresso machine with pressurized baskets that I use it in, so grind isn't as important, but this is more finely ground than other ground coffees I've purchased.|1
813|813|Pleased with the coffee and purchase.|1
814|814|Great Coffee|1
815|815|BEst coffee|1
816|816|Great flavor and aroma.  Makes morning a whole lot easier|1
817|817|Great coffee, very strong.  Bought it for a good price on Amazon|1
818|818|Didn't know much about this company, but tried it out in the office.  It is now the coffee of choice!!!|1
819|819|as expected|1
820|820|The flavor like all Peet's coffee is fantastic. You would never know it is decaf.|1
821|821|Great coffee, the best|1
822|822|Love this coffee!!!  It totally met my expectations.  We first had Peets at our daughter's home in the Washington, DC area.  I searched several supermarkets in the area we live before finding it.  The flavor is very vibrant, very bold and rich!|1
823|823|Nice smooth coffee, always enjoy.  No bitter aftertaste.|1
824|824|Great coffee!!|1
825|825|Love Peets and this was a great way to get it!|1
826|826|Love the flavor.|1
827|827|"Was expired after I received it. The ""freshest by date is 12/31/17 and the roasted date is 10/02/17. I received this and it was already expired."|0
828|828|Great taste and produce|1
829|829|This coffee has an excellent flavor, arrives fresh and aromatic. I can recommend it to anyone who likes a decaf coffee!|1
830|830|My favorite coffee!|1
831|831|Slightly cheaper when I buy from Amazon. I use this coffee almost every day in a French press and it comes out great.|1
832|832|Dark and rich|1
833|833|Another favorite of mine.|1
834|834|I have always used this coffee. Kinda  addictive|1
835|835|Great coffee|1
836|836|Great tasting coffee|1
837|837|Kind of spendy but the strongest decaf I have found.|1
838|838|Smells so good and tasty, not too bitter. You don't even add milk in it.|1
839|839|Excellent coffee at a good price. Delivery was fast.|1
840|840|Excellent coffee, with that intense taste of dark French roast.  Packaged well and delivered on time.|1
841|841|great dark roast coffee|1

843|843|Excellent flavor!|1
844|844|Wonderful coffee!|1
845|845|Very good coffee.|1
846|846|Perfect balanced.|1
847|847|I am struggling to determine the best adjective to describe this decaf coffee, so I'll just say that it's the best cup I've ever had.  I'm sticking with Peet's Decaf French Roast.|1
848|848|our favorite coffee!!|1
849|849|my sister liked it|1
850|850|Biiter and not as smooth as I expected. I had to add sugar and more cream to balance the taste.  Certainly I am not buying this brand again much too strong. I  get anxious and my heart beats faster.|0
851|851|Great coffee, as expected great flavor, good price when buying online.|1
852|852|Great full bodied flavor|1
853|853|I have purchased this blend before and loved the bold richness of this coffee.  This purchase is a total disappointment.  It is very weak, no matter how many more tablespoons I add.  I tastes dry and stale.  Will not purchase this brand from Amazon.  Bummer.  This coffee will set in my emergency stash, only if I run out of the drinkable ones.|0
854|854|Way better than the other brands.|1
855|855|Coffee was overdue on 02/15/2018 。It arrived on the02/09/2018|0
856|856|I mean it,,,  Wonderful!|1
857|857|bright. bold. doesn't weigh heavy on the tongue|1
858|858|I order my ground coffee and k cups from Amazon all the time.  We love this coffee the best.  It's robust without any bitterness at all.|1
859|859|Super yummy dark coffee|1
860|860|Peet's is some of the best coffee I have ever had.|1
861|861|Got on time served at my coffee clutch with the girls.  Has a different taste but good.|0
862|862|Peet's Major Dickinson's dark roast is the best coffee around, beats Starbucks by a mile.  The price is great, also.|1
863|863|Great coffee.|1
864|864|Great coffee.|1
865|865|Love this coffee. Great robust taste, esp. for decaf! Will order again.|1

890|890|Mocha Java decaf by Peet's is the bestDecaf-hope they are not discontinuing it!!|1
891|891|Delicious deep roast coffee. It is strong so you can use less grounds to make a full pot!|1
892|892|Excellent|1
893|893|Very surprised ! Much better that I thought it would be. Not bitter at all. I will buy this again . I am a Starbucks fan just thought I would try something new.|1
894|894|This coffee is great, but the price fluctuates quite a bit.  We bought a Breville Espresso Machine so all of a sudden we had a need for affordable, quality espresso beans.  I looked at several options on Amazon and settled on this.  With subscribe and save it was initially under $5 a package but since that initial purchase, it has fluctuated between $5-$7.  Despite the price increase, we still have reordered 15 to 20 times.  I love the quality and taste and will continue to order these beans until I find something cheaper.|1
895|895|Great coffee|1
896|896|Great flavor|1
897|897|My favorite.  And with Subscribe and Save it makes it even better.|1
898|898|Best coffee ever.|1
899|899|This coffee was really good.  Been trying to find it in New York, but haven't been able to.  I think it's worth the few extra bucks to get it delivered.  I've ordered twice now and each time the coffee comes fresh and still very aromatic.  Also, I think the caffeine content is pretty high, as I'm more awake on this brand then other brands like starbucks and fairway market brands.|1
900|900|Purchased this on August15 for $8.88 now it's over $14. Great coffee but can't justify the price increase.|1
901|901|Great, strong taste. Best at-home coffee I've had in a while. Just bought my second bag!|1
902|902|Delivered promptly and loved the coffee. Will order again.|1

928|928|Nice taste|1
929|929|For some reason 8 O'Clock coffee is not currently supplying my favorite whole bean Italian roast lately, so I tried this version. Frankly it is not very robust and lacks full bodied flavor. I didn't even finsh the whole package before I switched to Starbucks French Roast instead. That one is pretty good.Peter|0

938|938|Delicious, Rich, full bodied coffee. Among the very best!|1
939|939|I ordered two orders and both times the coffee had no scent....just called peets in berkeley , they shipped me 4 bags and it is great....the original great coffee....before starbucks....no comparison.....PEETS is the very best....|0
940|940|when I stayed in SF last yr, I exprienced this coffee, I was so touched by it. Since that time, I have ordered it many times,|1
941|941|Great tasting coffee - full bodied.|1
942|942|Peet's Domingo  is a perfect medium roast.  As I get older the taste of the dark roasts are not as appealing as they once were but not quite ready for the weaker light roasts.  This roast is not bitter and has a nice after taste. I find this roast slightly better than Starbucks Pike roast. I highly recommend this coffee.|1
943|943|I thought coffee was coffee until I tried Peet's. There is no comparison! Thank you for a bright start to my day.|1
944|944|This is great coffee|1
945|945|bought different kinds of coffee for 40 years.  even 70.00 a lb Jamaica Blue Mountain.....it was a gift but still not what I was looking for.  Saw Peet's in the store for the 1st time a few years ago and it ended my search.  Absolutly love it.  There is no better coffee for my money.|1
946|946|Very good. Will purchse again|1
947|947|love the smooth taste.|1
948|948|My rating is for the Costa Rica blend. It was harsh, bitter, absolutely disgusting. In addition to the poor taste, the coffee also tasted as if the grounds were either really old, or hadn’t been properly sealed despite the bag being closed.I normally like peets coffee, but this blend was atrocious. Zero notes of molasses, black currant, or any sweetness whatsoever.|0
949|949|The absolute best in coffee...full body and flavor without being overpowering|1
950|950|The coffee was as expected BUT THE BAG HAD BEEN SLIT AND PLACED INSIDE ANOTHER PLASTIC BAG. I really think that one should have been trashed and replaced with an intact bag. My poor husband was trying to help and he had already made me two pots of coffee when he told me what had happened. NOT HAPPY|0
951|951|Big Bang was not to my liking. I brewed it many ways and with various ratios of water to grounds and never hit a sweet spot. It was without any memorable flavor and was best with whole milk added. Thst is not how I like my coffee. Black it was awful.|0
952|952|Great coffee!|1
953|953|Everybody loves my Mr. Peets coffee.|1
954|954|Delicious! The price was as good as buying in the grocery store but, shipped to your door!  Very good flavor and I will definitely buy it again.|1
955|955|Amazing|1
956|956|trial, it was good|1
957|957|Thank you Amazon for the subscribe and saving (is that a verb now?) Peets Italian Roast! It is the energy source in our house and nothing else will do. Unfortunately it is an expensive habit, but SnS allows us to spend $6.99 a bag! Yes, thank you...We will take 4 every month. Thank you. Thank you!|1
958|958|seller excellent, goods qualitative|1
959|959|Not very strong for my taste. For a reference I am used to having Starbucks French Roast. This is not nearly as strong, beans are brown compared to SB black. I ended up mixing the beans in with SB, but wont be purchasing this again. Still looking for a strong SB FR replacement.|0
960|960|We wanted to like this coffee very much. It was suggested to us by a former boutique wine and coffee shop employee, and we have always liked her advice. It is just not tasty; the taste would make me want to give up coffee.|0
961|961|I did not enjoy this coffee at all. Peet’s is usually a safe bet, but I would not recommend this flavor at all. I couldn’t figure out why the flavor was so harsh and not flavorful. I think maybe the citrus blend makes it so acidic. I’m not really an expert, so I don’t know. I’m looking forward to trying their other blends.|0
962|962|Its always just perfect.|1
963|963|Just great coffee!|1
964|964|Great coffee!!|1
965|965|Perfect!!!!|1
966|966|I am a newer coffee drinker and I don't want to always habe to add items to coffee to drink it. This is not very bitter and it does not have a burnt taste as some coffees do so I can deink it black and for a treat add in extras if wanted|1
967|967|Great price|1
968|968|Given the price per pound and the bland, but heavy flavor, I would not buy this again. The grind is very powdery, so you're going to get an extended brew process since the water pools in the filter, and there's absolutely nothing special about the flavor. Seriously, there are much less expensive coffees that are way better.|0
969|969|It's Peets. What else needs be said.|1
970|970|Great coffee, smooth|1
971|971|May not have really been the correct beans. Brewed up like cardboard!! This coffee should have been stronger than a pistol|0
972|972|Excellent|1
973|973|It stays the same yr after yr , with the bold flavor I enjoyed the first time I had it|1
974|974|The Caf'e Domingo is a great coffee - highly recommended for low acidity - the only problem is Peets NO LONGER HAS IT AVAILABLE - I called Peets and they informed me that it is now discontinued - what a shame as it was a great coffee|1
975|975|As advertised, an excellent Medium Roast coffee intended for a thank you package to the coffee lover...I bought several brands to say thank you for a deed well done and will post this review in each. This one was to represent the Pacific Northwest's love affair with whole bean coffees...dj|1
976|976|Forget about Starbucks (IMHO)...their coffee is typically too burnt tasting for my buds (maybe they over-roast?). Major Dickason is full-bodied with subtle layers of numerous tastes and aromas. It makes equally great moka espresso (using our 5-cup Bialetti) and auto-drip (using a brown no. 4 Melitta filter on our 12-cup Cuisinart).The only non-positive thing is that it's typically cheaper at our local store when it's on sale (which is often).Highly recommended, with the pricing caveat.Peet's spawned Starbucks (founded by former employees, I believe?...then it was bought by Howard Schultz in the 80's), but, in my opinion, Starbucks' quality doesn't match Peet's.|1
977|977|"I am on a quest to find the best decafe coffee and while this was OK, it wasn't my ""dream"" coffee.  Could not taste any mocca flavor but I use flavored creamer so it really did not matter that much.  I would love to find one that I could just drink with half and half or even black."|1
978|978|THIS IS MY FAVORITE COFFEE. THE REASON FOR THE MEDIOCRE REVIEW IS THAT BOTH BAGS CAME WITH THE VACUUM SEAL BROKEN. THEY WERE NOT BRICK SOLID AT ALL AS THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE. I ACTUALLY HAVE A SEAL TOOL AND WAS ABLE TO RE-SEAL THEM. I WON'T DO IT AGAIN THOUGH. NEXT TIME THEY WILL GO BACK!|0
979|979|I purchased this based on all the fabulous reviews. It's terrible, bitter coffee. I'm going to have to throw it away because I don't think I'll be able to drink it.|0
980|980|"Love Pete's Major Dickason's Blend.  It's the only coffee we buy.  However, we received product with expired ""Best Purchased by"" date.  This does not mean the coffee is rancid, but we would not have purchased if we knew it would arrive out of date."|0
981|981|I love this coffee|1
982|982|excellent coffee|1
983|983|How do I love thee? Let me count the ways:1) You are always roasted dark and rich without any hint of burnt beans (I am scowling at you Starbucks!)2) You go through our superautomatic espresso machine without clogging up the works3) You are so well balanced that my hubby likes you black and you are robust enough to withstand my cream and vanilla sugar4) You are priced right for how good you are and are on sale oftenThank you for waking us up with a smile on our faces!|1
984|984|Coffee tastes fine (nothing special), but the ground coffee itself has a terrible smell, in my opinion. It doesn't even smell like coffee...it smells borderline offensive but I can't identify exactly what it is about the smell that I don't like. I most likely wouldn't buy again.|0
985|985|Too expensive but very good coffee.|1
986|986|This is a phenomenal coffee - I am really impressed with the Peet's coffee, and usually don't opt for an Italian Roast because it is a little dark for my taste.  However, this coffee, freshly ground and sent through the AeroPress, was a phenomenal Italian Roast coffee...one of the best I've ever had of this variety.  Smoky and rich, but incredibly smooth! A++|1
987|987|Major Dickason's Blend is one of my all-time favorite coffees.  I like to cold brew a whole bag at a time with my Toddy cold brewer and add a little flavored creamer.  I have tried so many other kinds but always find myself coming back to this one.|1
988|988|This is not a strong coffee at all. I am nor sure what kind of beans the seller uses. They are dark, but very mild taste.I only drink Espresso, for many years, so I know the difference between weak and strong coffee.|0
989|989|Our family really like this bold flavor! We recommend buy this product...it stays fresh and will order Peet's coffee again.|1
990|990|I did not actually get to drink this, but I purchased this as a gift to a friend. I do like Peet's Coffee, or at least the varieties I have tried. My friend told me that this is excellent coffee, so I am happy.|1
991|991|This stuff is good if you like acidic, bitter, and dark coffee. If you don't like that stuff then, go to Starbucks and get your halfcalf 2pump vanilla latte, and turn your man card in.|1
992|992|It's OK a little pricey for the taste and only 12 ounces!! Seemed old too!!|0
993|993|Love this coffee! Im daily 1-2 cup drinker, this stuff sooo good! Used to drink Tim Hortons on regular, gave this a try & hooked. I had this at cafes in DC before, never bought some for home tho|1
994|994|I must say this is one of the best dark roasts I ever had. Preferred over eight o'clock dark french roast. Very well balanced and it's got the perfect punch to it. Grind fresh daily for use in my french press|1
995|995|The coffee is only okay. It finishes with a bit of a bitter, acidic citrus. Not my style. Ended up throwing my bag out. Wouldn't buy again. Others may like the taste.|0
996|996|will use it up, it's ok but probably won't buy again pretty good flavor but just not what we we're looking for I guess not bad just not for us|0
997|997|This is one of my husband's favorite coffee beans to use with his French Press.  He loves the flavor and freshness of it!|1
998|998|Yuck.  This had no taste, and when I opened the pkg there wasn't even a coffee smell.  It's either old coffee or lousy.|0
999|999|I bought this as a gift for my soon-to-be son-in-law. He wanted to try a coffee that a friend had told him about. Unfortunately neither knew the name of the coffee, but after some research I figured it had to be Peet's. After checking back, he said it sounded familiar. Well, he absolutely LOVED the coffee! To make it last, he has only been drinking it once or twice a week. He lives in Virginia, and hasn't been able to find it any of the stores there so far. I hope to be able to buy him some more soon. He was born in Germany (his dad is in the Army, stationed there for awhile) and was brought up on German coffee, and he says that Peet's rivals what he used to drink. So, all in all, Peet's Coffee is a GREAT flavored, strong brew coffee.|1
1000|1000|Great coffee, terrible price for 12 oz size. Local retail prices are $4 - $5 less than Amazon, and I live in a notoriously expensive place.|0
1001|1001|I purchased this by mistake as I'm not a flavored coffee person. This is really good. Actually buying another bag.|1
1002|1002|Its ok coffee but you get what you pay for. It's on the cheaper end of whole bean coffee. It gets the job done but you won't be blown away.|0
1003|1003|I love Peet's coffee and I was excited to see it in espresso!  The flavor is amazing.Just know it is not ground, I thought it was.|1
1004|1004|Expired on 3/21. Received 3/22|0
1005|1005|I used to like Peet's decaf but this time it was very bitter and harsh.  Not good.|0
1006|1006|Very fresh. Very finely ground....espresso ground more so then drip coffee.  Very dark roast.|0
1007|1007|Coffee expiration date is just a few days out when I receive my product.|0
1008|1008|I love this  coffee. All the flavor of rich coffee, without the caffeine. Perfect!|1
1009|1009|not bad coffee is price is right get but it's avg at best|0
1010|1010|Coffee was good but currently experimenting.  Gonna try other brands/flavors.|1
1011|1011|Disappointed. Didn't taste like what I was expecting. I won't buy this coffee again.|0
1012|1012|Introduced to Peet's by our son Jeff who lives in CA we knew the quality and flavor of this coffee is extraordinary. Thanks Jeff & Peet!|1
1013|1013|Can I get a big yum for this. Much better than Major Dickasons blend.|1
1014|1014|Just wanted to try something new. Not as good as the Dunkin Donuts we usually drink.|1
1015|1015|Excellent value for full bodied, non-acidic coffee.|1
1016|1016|No mocca flavor what so ever. I've always been a fan of Peets coffee. It is not the robust taste I was expecting. A java it is not .|0
1017|1017|Really not that good. Pete's has better blends.|0
1018|1018|It is good,but i like dark roast better|1
1019|1019|I like Starbucks better!  Sorry!|0
1020|1020|I enjoy a good decaf - unfortunately Peet's Decaf French Roast didn't hit the mark, I didn't find it flavorful, maybe I got a bad batch ..|0
1021|1021|nice|1
1022|1022|delicious|1
1023|1023|Not as dark as I like|0
1024|1024|Love this book.|1
1025|1025|This is some of the best coffee I've ever had! I just recently started grinding my own coffee beans to get the best cup of joe possible. It's delicious and I will definitely be buying again!|1
1026|1026|Love this coffee for my espresso maker!|1
1027|1027|I like the taste and it is just grinned just right.|1
1028|1028|Very sweet cup of coffee, with hints of fruity taste. However, lack of the typical citrusy flavors of Ethiopian beans making me doubt the freshness the coffee beans.Nevertheless, it is a value for money choice, good as everyday coffee!|0
1029|1029|This coffee is extremely tasteless, light, and not worth the money.|0
1030|1030|"This coffee had a good background flavor that was ruined by a flavor that seemed like powdered dry ‘wheat stalks.’ I drink my coffee black and unsweetened, so the ‘wheat stalk’ flavor was very evident. I have tried at least a dozen coffees and tasted nothing like it. I tried a cup of Peet’s with a modest amount of cream, and the ‘wheat stalk’ flavor was hidden. The coffee tasted good. I don’t know if artificial creamers will hide the ‘wheat stalk’ flavor.It’s possible that many people cannot taste the slightly bitter ‘wheat stalks.’ I am a ""taster"" and can taste more bitter substances than the vast majority. For those of you who can’t taste the ‘wheat stalks’ and like Peet’s, be wary of serving it to guests."|0
1031|1031|Dash button!  Oddly, wrong product delivered.  Have had this dash set up for quite some time.  First malfunction.|0
1032|1032|Love this coffee and the convenience of subscription delivery!|1
1033|1033|Wonderful coffee, but arrived very late.|0
1034|1034|Best coffee around!!|1
1035|1035|Bland coffee. Absolutely no flavor. Coffee was just shy of expectation date.|0
1036|1036|Delicious!|1
1037|1037|Like most decaf's, not robust|0
1038|1038|The coffee is decent but it is ground way too finely, almost as fine as what you would expect for an espresso not a drip coffee maker.|0
1039|1039|The coffee is great. However I wanted the whole beans. I received whole beans on my first order-unfortunately my first shipment was ground. Very disappointed|0
1040|1040|"It said ""2-pack"".  I only received one and it looked as if it had been stepped on."|0
1041|1041|Pretty flavorless, but it get the job done.|0
1042|1042|Good coffee but there are better ones.|1
1043|1043|didnt like it at all. I wonder why ppl gace so many good reviews here.|0
1044|1044|Amazing|1
1045|1045|I'm sure this coffee is great. However, I received caffeinated whole bean Major Dickanson's Blend instead of ground decaf Mocca-Java.|0
1046|1046|I wanted French Roast, just not decaf.|0
1047|1047|I only got 1 pack of Peet’s Coffee.|0
1048|1048|This is excellent coffee. Best flavor, better than any Starbucks. I drink a big cup every morning and my bowel movements are huge and painless and right on time. Then I am ready to take on the world. Thanks Peet!|1
1049|1049|Got to love Peet's coffee! I don't mess around with my coffee, the first time i tried the french roast i knew it would be my go to.thank Jesus Amazon has it, because i can't find it in my town|1
1050|1050|Not medium roast. Over roasted, beans are shiny with oil from age and over roasting. Bitter, tastes a little better than Folgers. Back to trader Joe's brand.|0
1051|1051|I love peets coffee but this one sucks. This is a very light rost. I need 2 cups to feel like I got my coffee fill|0
1052|1052|This claims to be a strong coffee.  It came through the coffee pot looking like tea and tasted VERY WEAK.  I threw it out.|0
1053|1053|Hubby is a coffee connoisseur of sorts and he enjoys this brand. Unfortunately, you have to be aware of the products economic fluctuations, which is why I deducted one star. It sways a Washington or two. We stick to a party of Lincoln and three Washingtons or less.|1
1054|1054|It was NOT ground, it was beans. And unfortunately our shipping department accidentally cut the bag so I can't return it.|0
1055|1055|not a good price for this product|0
1056|1056|Coffee was fine but it was more expensive than my neighborhood store.|0
1057|1057|Peet’s need to start making their coffee in a more sustainable and biodegradable package!|1
1058|1058|Always read the 1 star reviews before buying!  I can't believe these charlatans are getting away with the lie that you are getting 2 packages instead of one.  All I can do for now is give a 1 star review.UPDATE: contacted Amazon and got a half refund, so I'm happier.  I also requested they fix the web page.|0
1059|1059|This is my favorite coffee and I thought that I was ordering the decaf version of this coffee as the picture on Amazon shows the green decaffeinated strip on the coffee label.  There was no info in the product description stating whether the coffee was regular or decaf so I assumed that the picture was correct.  I can get the regular version of this coffee locally all day long.  Need the decaf version.|0
1060|1060|I ordered whole bean coffee (several bags) and ground coffee was delivered instead.|0
1061|1061|Didn't realize that this was decafe, and perhaps is good for one who needs little or no caffeine, however I am a coffee drinker and need my caffeine.|0
1062|1062|I dont know that its not ready|0
1063|1063|"During the search on Amazon this particular Peet's Coffee was listed as DECAF coffee and the photo next to the product description shows a green ""Decaffeinated"" label as well as ""whole beans"".  This is NOT decaffeinated and it is ground.  Amazon--get your descriptions and photos corrected!  Unfortunately this is a non-returnable item so I'm stuck."|0
1064|1064|Perhaps I just bought the wrong blend, but my husband and I didn't like it at all.  Since I bought two bags of it, I gave one to my daughter.  She didn't like it either.  We threw our rest of the bag out.|0
1065|1065|This coffee comes from Berkeley CA, home of antifa|0
1066|1066|"I purchased a 12 oz bag of Peet's Coffee - Big Bang (medium roast) whole bean at the local Kroger today. It was on a special display at the end of an aisle, on sale, and caught my attention. After recent changes to the reward program for a large coffee chain which drastically reduced the ""rewards"" for regular coffee drinkers, I made a vow to make my own at home and save money. I purchased a small KRUPS F203 coffee grinder (love it!) and am starting out on my own ""tasting tour"" of all the different whole bean coffees I can find locally available.I personally prefer medium roasts, and I REALLY liked the Peet's Big Bang. It is very smooth, a clean taste and not bitter at all. You may not like it if your preference is a darker roast, but I think light roast lovers would like this one.The Amazon price (currently $10.44) is a little more than the sale price I paid, but less than the ""regular"" price displayed at the grocery store. I will definitely buy this coffee again, and would be willing to buy it here if it becomes unavailable locally.------ Update ------This update is written about two months after my initial review. As someone who prefers medium roasts, this has become my daily choice. The local grocery store (Kroger) has run several specials on Peet's Big Bang (whole bean) over the past 8 weeks, and on sale (for $6.99), it is currently about half the price of the marketplace offerings here online."|1
1067|1067|Not thrilled about this purchase|0
1068|1068|"Peet's Major Dickason's blend is probably my favorite coffee to buy without shelling out big bucks for a premium artisan roaster. Yes, there are better coffees out there, but often you're paying twice as much for a coffee that isn't THAT much better. Before discovering Peet's I used to order Klatch rain forest blend (still my favorite coffee) and it was significantly more expensive. Now, most of the time I can find Peet's on sale, or order it cheap online for about half the price. A coffee that's 90% as good for half the price, I'll take it.Very dark roast, in my opinion, a touch darker than I prefer. That's the only ""warning"" I have."|1
1069|1069|Five stars for the coffee.  One star for the misleading description on the page.  The first line of the description states:2 x 12 ounce bags of Peet's Major Dickason's Blend Whole Bean coffeeWhat an excellent price for two twelve ounce bags!  That's because you don't get two twelve ounce bags.  You only get one.  No returns allowed!  Fix the wording Amazon!!NOTE:  Amazon has fixed the wording after two years.  I really don't require anyone else pointing that out to me.|0
1070|1070|Wow. I'd heard of this coffee, but didn't get around to trying it until now. It's incredible. When I opened the bag, I was concerned with how dark the coffee beans are, afraid they would taste burnt. Those beans are almost black. They're also really shiny. They look wet from the amount of oily bean goodness in them. I've used these to make standard brew and espresso. They make a very fine cup of standard strength coffee, but I think they really shine as espresso. Very dark, very rich, and surprisingly smooth. So much flavor, but not the bitterness I usually taste with dark roasts. I'm hooked!|1
1071|1071|Absolutely delicious. While it's a bit on the bitter side, it's still very fragrant and a little chocolatey. Not sure if its a packaging issue but the top of the bag tends to be stale while the middle and bottom tastes best though the bottom is kind of oily. I'd recommend giving the bag a good shake once you're halfway through to make sure your coffee is consistent. This is my go to since Costco stocks it in the 2lb variety and it's basically the only good coffee they stock.|1
1072|1072|Peet's decaf coffees are among the best I've had in decaf. The flavors are rich, complex and balanced, with no strange aftertastes like I get with some decaf coffees. I've tried the decaf versions of French Roast, Major Dickason's Blend and House Blend. French Roast is the darkest and most robust of the three, a truly traditional and satisfying French roast style. Major Dickason's is dark-to-medium with superb combination of of bright and deep aromas, and makes an excellent brew, even at varying strengths. House Blend is a medium roast, the lightest of the three, and makes a delightfully smooth cup. All three are highly recommended!|1
1073|1073|The best decaf hands down. So rich, it's unlike any other decaf I've tried. The color is gorgeous. I use a French press and it even produces a nice crema. Super full-bodied. Not harsh at all. I have a burr grinder but stopped grinding (other brands) since I found this. Now I need to find these beans whole and I'll grind again... That will be the ultimate. You can't even compare this decaf to others... It's that good.|1

1075|1075|I have IBS, and have heard that dark roasts have less acid and are therefore more gentle on the stomach. It is surprisingly hard to find a decaf dark roast. After a lot of searching, this was the first I found, so I gave it a try. It tastes good, but even more importantly to me, my stomach handles it MUCH better than Folgers, etc. Really glad I found this blend, and hope they never stop making it!|1
1076|1076|This coffee is so good. The item came clean in good condition.Let me tell you if you are a coffee drinker but you don't want the caffeine this is the coffee for you. It is rich but no caffeine to keep you up at night.|1
1077|1077|Ditched our Keurig after is finally started having problems.  Had been so long since I bought a bog of beans or ground coffee we wanted to try something new.  Remembered Peets being recommended by a true coffee gormand.  So we bought a bag of this on sale at our local grocer (Publis) for $6.99 ($3.90 off the regular price).  It is everything the other positive reviewers have posted.  We will buy this again for sure.  Came on to Amazon to compare pricing and read the reviews before we opened the bag.|1
1078|1078|Peet's coffee has an interesting history. It predates starbuck$ and the founder of starbucks was actually mentored at Peet's. I like a deep, strong, robust coffee and Peet's delivers. It's Major Dickason blend is a dark roast that stands up to my french press, and even makes a good espresso. This is not a smooth Kenny G. blend, this is a hard rock grab you by the throat and scream here I am! blend. I don't drink my coffee with anything, no sweetener, no milk or cream to obscure the taste, so I need a really good coffee that is strong without being bitter and Peet/s Major Dickason's Blend is a really good choice.|1
1079|1079|Awesome awesome coffee!!! First I was attracted to the package because it looked different from others. By the way, this is The Best Coffee I ever found at the regular grocery store shelves. I love the aroma from the bag and the coffee in the cup!!! I will keep buying this one and will be my signature morning coffee in my home... <3|1
1080|1080|PEETS IS THE BEST!.....But order from them directly at the PEETS website because they don't roastYour beans until you order them and the result is that you get the freshest beans possible for a great price. They have subscription discounts and shipping is cheap. Trust me, nothing beats getting beans in your mail box that were roasted only a couple of days prior!|1
1081|1081|My favorite peet's coffee was the cafe domingo but, I think they stopped making it.  Brazil Minas is a close second to cafe domingo, it's still really good though.  Brazil Minas is super smooth and has a slight carmel nuttiness to it, I love the smell you get from smelling the bag. This is a regular buy for me.|1
1082|1082|Disclaimer: I am by no means a coffee aficionado. I like to change the grind I buy fairly frequently to find what I like, usually opting for what's on sale to have during the week when all I really need is just a little bit of a caffeine boost to get me through the day. However, I always have a bag of Peet's coffee on hand to serve when I have guests in town. I've always loved Peet's coffee, but I especially love this Columbia Luminosa blend. It has a nice rich aroma, medium bold flavor, and low acidity/bitterness. By comparison, I've had Jablum Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee, Ground 8oz which is touted as the best in the world because of it's low acidity and bitterness. I'd say this comes 75% close to that same level of mouth feel, but not nearly as expensive. I've served this after dinner to guests on at least three different occasions, and during each time, at least one person has asked me what kind of coffee I made as they felt it tasted really good.Well, I apparently outed myself and my husband found out my secret. He says I'm holding out on him by only serving the good stuff when people are in town. I tried to explain to him its like how we only have the nice hand towels in the guest bathroom, but he wasn't having any of it. A few times I've caught him dipping into my secret stash of Peet's coffee to use in the mornings for our day to day. Guess I'll be reordering soon, and possibly adding this to my monthly subscribe and save.|1
1083|1083|Major DIckason's is a signature blend of Peet's brand.  To me, it's a full flavor profile without excess acidity; bright enough to be an everyday coffee.  Peet's are now owned by a German coffee conglomerate (they own Stumptown, Keurig and Caribou too).  You will see Peet's in more distribution channels than ever, yet product quality has not suffered as a result.|1
1084|1084|Dissapointed. Description led me to believe this to be a bold, dark roast, without bitterness. Does not taste dark, has a very btter, acidic taste, which lingers far after the cup is gone. I need to go brush my teeth to rid the bad taste. And, I feel like I have heartburn from the acidity. Uggh|0
1085|1085|Really like this coffee and I'm a coffee snob.  Much better than DD, Starbucks, and the weird $12 for a small container fair trade, vegan, organic, single source coffees you can find out there.  Good day-to-day coffee.Available via Amazon dash which is great too.|1
1086|1086|Flavor was not all that spectacular, as their marketing team would have you believe.  Far more problematic was that grind was a fine as one can get, i.e. for espresso.  This level of grind should always be called out, since most people use other brewing methods, a french press in my case.|0
1087|1087|If you hate bitter coffee but like strong coffee this is the one for you! Once I tried this brand I will not drink any other coffee unless I'm dining out. It's smooth and flavorful along with being cost effective.|1
1088|1088|I was expecting a little better for the price.  It's smooth and uncomplicated.  For a medium roast I was expecting a little more complexity.  Live and learn, I probably won't buy again.|0
1089|1089|I was indecisive for a long time about my favorite coffee, but Major Dickasen's is among my top favorites, along with 8 O'clock Original and Colombian flavor.I usually purchase at Sam's Club for the largest possible size at a good price.I use a Kuerig K45 Elite and reusable mesh baskets to wash out the flavors. This ensures every cup is fresh for me.|1
1090|1090|Peets has been a favorite of mine--especially the Major Dickason's, Sumatra, and Aged Sumatra.  I like the strength of the beans without any bitterness.  I have tried many, many others, but Peets still comes out on top...|1
1091|1091|Great price for half a pound. Great coffee quality as always from Peet's. Blows Starbucks away as the best chain coffee.|1
1092|1092|We always buy Peets coffee, but always shop the sales because it can be pricey. Ordering on a subscription means we've always have a stash of our favorite coffee at a rock bottom price. You can't beat the convenience of home delivery.|1
1093|1093|If you're going mainstream with your coffee, Peet's is the way to go. It's not burned, has a great robust flavor that doesn't get watered down by simple additions. There's nothing more annoying than making a should-be strong cup, adding a little half-and-half and then wondering where the flavor of your coffee went. Peet's has a large assortment of grounds as well, which is nice if you're the type that likes to venture from the ordinary with different traditional coffees. I used to drink Starbucks, but their coffee is routinely burned and acidic. This is well-rounded in comparison and strong, without being too bitter.|1
1094|1094|Oh how I wish this was a cheaper brand. I drink too much coffee to buy the premium coffee much, but this is a great tasting coffee. I drink it black|1
1095|1095|i give a four star to this product simply because it is too strong for me personaly. i am typically in the range of medium to dark but this is for people who like deeper end of the roast spectrum|1
1096|1096|Yummy coffee!  I have tried all kinds of decaf and this stuff is the best, even better than Starbuck's decaf.  My problem is finding it in stock at the supermarket so I think I will start just ordering it here on Amazon.|1
1097|1097|I bought 3 different Peet's coffee. Columbia Luminosa, Costa Rica Aurora, and Big Bang. All were very good, but a bit too expensive for my tastes.|1
1098|1098|Very good decaf coffee.  Very Flavorful.|1
1099|1099|Love this coffee! Delivered fresh. There's a lot of flavor but not enough depth (I have to mix it with another strong coffee so get the perfect depth and flavor I want). I would purchase again!|1
1100|1100|Perhaps I am not brewing this coffee correctly. I read all the rave reviews about it being rich and not bitter. I've tried various amounts in my Bonavita 1800 brewer and it always comes out tasting bitter. I did buy the pre-ground and not the beans so Im wondering if its because the pre-ground coffee is too fine and it needs to be more coarse? Unlike most drip coffee makers the bonavita extracts coffee extremely well. I may have to get some beans and give this coffee another shot ground up more coarsely.|0
1101|1101|In my opinion, there is much better, richer espresso on the market. Personal taste I suppose, but not my cup of tea (um, coffee).|0
1102|1102|We essentially stopped buying all other brands once we tried Peet's.  Rich, roasty, complex, all variants good but not sharp/burnt tasting like a Starbucks.HOWEVER - this price it utterly ridiculous.  Target, Wegman's, Shoprite all sell for ~$9/bag.  Costco started selling the bags of beans as well for a good price (I can't recall).|1
1103|1103|Very good smooth coffee.  I prefer medium to dark roasted coffees and this fits the bill.  This coffee is rich, smooth and not bitter at all.  I will definitely be purchasing this again.  Highly recommend.|1
1104|1104|Coffee arrived to me and is expiring in 2 days. Watch out for expiration dates. There's obviously no way we can go through the entire package in 2 days. Requested refund.|0
1105|1105|Well balanced--my hubby likes it black and yI love it with milk and sugar. We searched a long time for a mutually loved coffee and Columbia Luminosa seems to hit the mark.|1
1106|1106|I finally found an excellent decaf ground coffee, in the form of Peet's French Roast decaf, ground, in 12oz. bags.I've been buying it for months at local Ralph's markets, as they regularly on 'sale', for $8.99 per 12oz. bag.This makes a great cup of coffee that actually tastes like good coffee, and is a decaf.Now if I can only find an on-line seller for less.|1
1107|1107|Was super happy with the quality of this coffee. Freshly roasted, and full of flavor when it arrived, on time, and as promised. On the light side of medium roast, which I love, and is every bit as good as much higher priced beans. Highly recommend!|1
1108|1108|While some reviewer here grouse about the price, it is indeed a 'price performance' winner, particularly since a major 'Warehouse' store (known for a flat 20% markup) began carrying it.  It certainly trumps Starmucks.  I find the blend VERY sensitive to brewing (over heating, or mis-handling), and loses much when simply transferred from a pot to a glass thermos (perhaps the trip in the air oxidizes the chocolate over-tones... dunno); cream users will not notice this nuance. Some users here claim that 'fresh coffee' (beans, or ground?) makes a big difference; that observation makes sense.  I do know iti began as a daily requested mixture by a MISTER Dickerson (1/2 Sumatra, 1/2 Columbian), and was put on the wall when many of the employees and customers preferred his request too.|1
1109|1109|Tastes like Folger’s that has been sitting on a hot plate for 5 hours.  I realize that many people like the “burnt toast” ruination of Peet’s and Starburnt, but I don’t.  It overwhelms any other flavor in the beans.  It is if they use a blowtorch after every roast.  Peets bought Intelligensia.  Hopefully, they will learn from their roasters how to roast beans.  I had one bag of Big Bang that was good.  I guess they forgot to torch it. I have drunk my last cup of Peets.|0
1110|1110|You can't call yourself an expert if you get the grind wrong and sell your errors to the public. I'm no expert either, but read enough to know that one reason why coffee tastes bitter is by over-grinding the beans. The grind is a powdery and gritty texture. The aroma is wonderful though. My nose was very happy. Since you take in the element to a degree by your whiffer, you could probably say that you had your coffee without drinking it. That way you stay euphoric through it's aromatic scent, without tainting your tasty buds from the finished product. Who knows, maybe you're able to create a good flavor, using a better quality coffeemaker and water.|0
1111|1111|Love this coffee!  I usually drink Starbucks but for the price this has a nice dark flavor that's great black.  Easy to drink and house guests always ask what kind of coffee they're enjoying!|1
1112|1112|Recently purchased this after years of drinking Starbucks, and it is so good. No bitterness, and smooth going down. Whole beans and grinding them yourself is the way to go!|1
1113|1113|I am in love with this coffee!!!  It's so good!  Using a grinder in a  blender/.grinder integrated into my coffee pot, when it cracks one bean, the entire kitchen smells heavenly.  I love coffee, but these beans are the best of the best.  They are roasted, and even has a date of roasting on it.|1
1114|1114|I love this coffee. It's smooth and bold, not bitter at all.|1
1115|1115|Peet's is a very good gourmet coffee. All of their product is at the top. However, this product via Amazon is old roast. I will never buy this product at Amazon again.|0
1116|1116|However.... two of the six packages that we received smelled like cat urine, as though a cat sprayed the outside of the packages.|1
1117|1117|"No! Just no! I know tastes differ but this is terrible. Smells of burnt tobbacco and has a very ""off"" taste. Not for me. I was looking for a new coffe to try and came across this one. It had great reviews so I gave it a shot."|0
1118|1118|Excellent.|1
1119|1119|Bought this for my son who is a heavy coffee drinker and he loves it over all others.|1
1120|1120|Makes good espresso, good price.  Win/win.|1
1121|1121|Great coffee, love the dark roast taste, very smooth and not bitter at all.|1
1122|1122|Good coffee beans. One of my favorites right now.|1
1123|1123|It tastes okay to me, but it's a bit too much like Charbucks burnt tasting for me to reorder this product.|0
1124|1124|This is a review for the Peet's Colombia Luminosa ground coffee. First, this is a light roast, so it's important to understand that, at least in my opinion, light roasts are an acquired taste. This has a delicate sweetness, great body, and a balanced acidity level that is really perfect for sipping black. It's hard for me give 5 star reviews, but this really edges up to about 4.3 in my book for a light roast, so I'm rounding it up.|1
1125|1125|Our favorite.|1
1126|1126|The best coffee ever.|1
1127|1127|Great coffee at a great price|1
1128|1128|Very flowery|0
1129|1129|I love this coffee! it is one of the few truly bold decaf coffees I have found.|1
1130|1130|Pleasant but expensive for the taste. You have to be a die-hard fan of Peet's, I think.|0
1131|1131|Love, love, love this coffee. I order 3 bags a month. Not too bitter but not weak at all and it's strength is easily adjusted by more or less in the basket.|1
1132|1132|Very nice flavor|1
1133|1133|Glad to be able to find Peet's Decaf at a reasonable price.  Hope to see some whole bean decaf soon.|1
1134|1134|Purchased this through my Peet's dash button. Personally like the flavor and product arrived quickly.|1
1135|1135|One of my favories. Light roast which for me was number 1 requirement, great taste. Go turkish style coffee!|1
1136|1136|Peet's Big BANG brewed to Perfection by a Bonavita Coffee Maker.  Life is GREAT.|1
1137|1137|Thought it would be a little milder...but using less grounds has made it more appealing to the taste.|1
1138|1138|I love Peet's regular coffee, but this decaf blend is awful.  I use a French press, so maybe that's it.  I'm wide open for decaf advice.  I'm pretty sensitive to caffeine - insomnia, anxiety, a couple of murders, etc. - but I love the taste of good coffee.  I can't even mix some of this with Peet's regular coffee because it tastes so bad.|0
1139|1139|Taste great. A good change in coffee verses buying Starbucks.|1
1140|1140|One of the best tasting bean coffees I've used.|1
1141|1141|This is some tasty coffee and makes a damn good cup of joe. I am now mixing this with a lighter blend and it hits the spot in the morning. Get some on sale if you can|1
1142|1142|This coffee is so good. Very smooth and has a excellent taste.|1
1143|1143|Small groups run on coffee... Pastor's Choice :)|1
1144|1144|So happy with the convenience of getting out coffee delivered. No more running out!!|1
1145|1145|not bitter and perfectly balanced. great find on subscribe and save|1
1146|1146|Love this stuff, nice flavor, not to bold and taste so so so good in the morning|1
1147|1147|Awesome coffee, great flavor and no bitterness. Great taste to start the day!|1
1148|1148|Peet's is my favorite coffee. Whenever I buy bulk or switch brands I can immediately taste the difference when going back to peet's. It's not the cheapest, but also not the most expensive. You won't be disappointed if you try it in my opinion.|1
1149|1149|An excellent decaf coffee, one of my favorites.|1
1150|1150|fresh, fast ship|1
1151|1151|Order the 12 oz. Honestly... it is just ridiculously small for $9. I mean, like a handful of beans. Can finish it in 3-4 days. Ridiculous they do not offer larger sizes for specific beans.|0
1152|1152|Average and very overpriced coffee.|0
1153|1153|love this coffee, beans are roasted dark with a nice shine to them, these are good beans roasted right!|1
1154|1154|I use this coffee. Love it! I came on here to see if I could save money... NOPE.I actually just paid $6.99 at Safeway/Vons. Guess I'll just stock up next time it's on sale.|1
1155|1155|This is great tasting coffee,|1
1156|1156|Tastes great but Peet's coffee make me so jittery - more than any other coffee. I make mine a bit weak and add milk.|0
1157|1157|Product arrived quickly just as promised.  Will buy again !|1
1158|1158|Very nice blend with the right balance|1
1159|1159|Great coffee with a good taste for me.|1
1160|1160|This is the first decaf coffee that I have purchased that I actually enjoy.  Purchased on sale and with a $1.00 coupon, so my price was $8.00.  I was hoping to see this available on S & S at a discount.|1
1161|1161|Good coffee.|1
1162|1162|So finely ground that is seeps through my k-cup coffee filter, but taste is good.|1
1163|1163|Peet's is superior coffee all around.|1
1164|1164|I usually am not a fan of decaf after drinking regular all these years but Peet's has the best tasting decaf I have ever tasted. I'm pregnant and it's going to make my caffeine transition so much easier!|1
1165|1165|Delicious coffee!|1
1166|1166|I love this coffee!  It has a very full body and yet not high in acidity.  I have always liked  full bodied coffee but this is simply the best.|1
1167|1167|I like to serve this to my guests...it is a real favorite!|1
1168|1168|Unlike the other reviewer, I'm going to actually rate this product based on the product itself, and NOT the price or the seller (after all, that's what PRODUCT reviews are for, right?).  Even if the asking price was $1,000/oz, I would still give this great product 5 stars, because it's just that - a great product.  It certainly does not deserve a single star next to it on the main product page.When it comes to decaf coffee, usually you have to sacrifice taste.  Not so with Peets Major Dickason's Decaf.  This is my absolute favorite decaf coffee, and it's the only decaf I've been drinking for the past 2 years, since I gave up caffeine.I probably won't be purchasing from Amazon because there are plenty of local Peets Coffee shops near both my home and work, and can get whole bean for about $15/lb.Can you tell I have a pet peeve of reviewers that mar a products rating because someone is asking a price they don't agree with?|1
1169|1169|Bad flavor, tasted like old beans. Probably from all the damp conditions in San Francisco where this is from. Basement bean coffee? Maybe I got a bad bag.....would not recommend.|0
1170|1170|I ordered this after tasting it at my son's house. Nice rich flavor.|1
1171|1171|The price of this coffee is absurd -- 20 bucks and then shipping tacked onto it? It's 10 bucks in the grocery store.That being said ...Major Dickason is my favorite Peet's blend -- not too dark like the French Roast but more interesting and slightly more nutty than the house blend. This is ground, however, which just isn't the same as grinding your own beans. I highly recommend getting a grinder and taking the extra few minutes to grind the beans -- it makes a ton ton TON of difference.|1
1172|1172|Great taste, better than Starbucks :)|1
1173|1173|Best French Roast decaf I've ever tasted. I must say though, I've really not seen a lot of it out there.|1
1174|1174|Good quality|1
1175|1175|Great coffee. It smells nice and I don't have problems taking it anytime of the day . Its so delicious|1
1176|1176|I'm sure that this is great coffee, but it keeps clogging my Gaggia Titanium machine.  We did a full clean-out, vacuum, and started it up again, and again an instant clog in the grinder.  The machine reported that we needed to add beans, and upon inspection the grinder was full of half-ground beans that weren't getting ground up and sent to the brew group.  Went through this vacuum and restart process two more times and finally on the 4th try, we used a different brand of beans.  The machine works fine now.|0
1177|1177|Love PEET's cofee.|1
1178|1178|It both tastes and smells very nice, I would definitely have more of this in the future|1
1179|1179|Dark, bold and delicious! I bought this at my local grocery store 6 months ago and its still favorite blend!|1
1180|1180|THIS COFFEE WILL MAKE YOU POOP YOUR BRAINS OUT. Seriously.But other than that, it is my new favorite. I buy a 12 pack of kcups at Kroger for 7.99 which totally trumps the 10.99 box of ten Starbucks kcups. If you love dark, strong coffee, this is it. I don't even care for Starbucks anymore.|1
1181|1181|Love the robust taste.|1
1182|1182|Another good coffee from the Northwest for this Northeast guy!|1
1183|1183|best coffee you can buy!!!!|1
1184|1184|The coffee is tasty but why is it so expensive here?  I bought this at the grocery store last weekend for $7.99.|1
1185|1185|This is amazing with a French press. Love the aroma.|1
1186|1186|I like light roast coffee and I like Peet's. This is very good coffee.|1
1187|1187|Nice bold beans.|1
1188|1188|Great tasting coffee. Works well in our machine and tastes absolutely delicious!|1
1189|1189|The flavor.|1
1190|1190|Best Coffee I've ever tasted! Excellent|1
1191|1191|Peet's has been my all-time favorite since I lived in San Francisco and frequented their establishment there. Major Dickason's is my favorite blend.  However, if you're lucky enough to live near a supermarket that sells it (and many do), you'll see that $13.49 is way overpriced for one 12-ounce bag. It's about 9 or 10 dollars, and on sale (which is often) about 8 dollars at the supermarket.  Amazon can do better. I was hoping to find it cheaper here so I could order it in bulk, but nope.This is just to say, if you haven't tried Peet's coffee, you owe it to yourself.|1
1192|1192|great coffee|1
1193|1193|The best coffee!!|1
1194|1194|The 2 stars is for the price, not the product. Peet's Major Dickason's Blend is one of my all time fave coffees. I buy the 12 oz. whole bean bags at my local Vons for 9 bucks a bag all the time. So unless you're agoraphobic or paralyzed save the extra 15 bucks or so that they're charging here and buy locally. It makes a great cup o joe as well as espresso, just grind accordingly.|0

1199|1199|Great coffee but not much of a deal here. Just bought at Safeway yesterday for 5.99 (12 oz)|1
1200|1200|I like this coffee a lot.|1
1201|1201|This dark roast is awesome! I usually like my coffee creamed but I'll make an exception for this!|1
1202|1202|This is seriously the best dark coffee I've ever tasted! I'm gonna be buying this from now on...|1
1203|1203|Great-tasting dark coffee. It's one of the best I've had. I would def buy again.|1
1204|1204|it's Peets coffee.  What else can you say?  This makes great coffee|1
1205|1205|I've always enjoyed Peet's coffee, but after my father introduced me to this blend and to the Uzuri blend --two of my current top favorites-- I am now a huge fan.  Smooth cups of coffee every time.|1
1206|1206|This is good coffee in any of the flavors and is the only coffee we drink. However, the price at the local grocery store is about $4.50 cheaper.|0
1207|1207|Excellent flAvor|1
1208|1208|Better than Peets Major Dickinson, better body and flavor.|1
1209|1209|smoky delicious with aroma that I am looking for.  I drink it hot in black with blue agave.  3 full teaspoons in 4-5 oz of hot water.  Works well with French press or dripping.  Great coffee anytime!|1
1210|1210|Great coffee|1
1211|1211|It is the best one at this price|0
1212|1212|Good but very robust|0
1213|1213|My local Walmart and Target both have this, ground or whole bean, at a regular price of less than $9 per 12 oz. bag. It's WAY overpriced here.It is an excellent coffee - I'm drinking it as I write this: an interesting hint of woody, creamy, citrusy taste that's dark but without the burnt aftertaste that comes with many dark roasts.|0

1215|1215|I made this my usual way, strong and rich, a heaping standard coffee scoop for a 10-oz mug through a #2 Melitta, and it took me back to the old days when I lived in the Bay Area, namely that Peet's is not my friend. Decent aroma, good color, but high in acid, a problem that I don't have with my Songbird coffees(from Thanksgiving Coffee of Ft Bragg, Ca.) or Santa Cruz Roasting beans.|0
1216|1216|This product was perfect! I bought it as a gift and my boyfriend loved it!!|1
1217|1217|This is an edit of my first review, where I said the price was a little high, but at that point I hadn't noticed that both my local Walmart and Target carry it for less than $9.So don't buy it here - though it's a great coffee. I use this coffee as a drip-grind coffee, not French-press or expresso where so many people love it. It's still 5 stars!This coffee is excellent: it's called a dark roast but it tastes more like a medium or medium-dark roast and doesn't have much bitter/burnt taste so common in such roasts. It's woody with a hint of a citrusy taste. It's a little creamy and earthy. There's a considerable complexity of tastes which reminds me of Eight O'Clock's Bocar Blend, but Bocar is not as bold - but it is around 2/3 the price.  Eight O'Clock's Columbian (my most-brewed in the AM coffee) is as bold with a little less complexity and a more woody taste, again at 2/3 the price. It most closely reminds me of Starbuck's Caffe Verona, which is a little more chocolately in taste and is usually around $8 for one about same sized bag at Amazon.|0
1218|1218|Not good...don't buy. Get Major Dickason|0

1220|1220|"We love Peet's Coffee and have been drinking it for years, and Major Dickason's Blend is our go-to flavor for every day brewing. Whether we are using the K Kups at work or grinding whole beans at home, this blend brews up good, dark, and delicious. The fragrance fills our offices and home, so that the uninitiated are soon asking, ""What are you drinking? It smells so good!"" And it tastes just as good as it smells. It's the perfect combination of beans in our opinion, and we can never get enough of it. Whether we brew it for breakfast to start the day, refrigerate it to drink it cold, or brew another pot to enjoy with dessert after a dinner with friends, it is always just right and warmly accepted by all of our friends. We must say, after sharing this brew with our guests, we've converted more than a few people into Peetniks (Peet's Coffee fans). One taste, and you'll likely be a convert too. Enjoy!"|1
1221|1221|Great find on warehouse deals.Was a little skeptical on coffee as a warehouse deal but I trust Amazon so took a shot.Arrived sealed, fresh, tasted great.The only difference between this bag and the last one we bought was the warehouse deals sticker was on it.Saved a TON.So worth it.|1
1222|1222|beans were roasted in January ....best if used by in two weeks...beans have been sitting around for awhile.....have not opened bag yet...dont think i will be able to grind and drink in two weeks..im getting old stock coffee beans..rotate your stock...not happy|0
1223|1223|"Nice full-bodied flavor here. This roast stand up to being brewed ""bold"" which is how I like it. Some blends get bitter when they're brewed strong, this isn't one of those. I'm not going to describe it in flowery terms. Just suffice it to say the stuff is great."|1
1224|1224|This rich coffee tastes great.  It appears to be freshly roasted and smells fantastic.  I ground some up and brewed it in a regular coffeemaker and wow.|1
1225|1225|I really wish Amazon would sell Peet's holiday blend. This is an ok standby. Just a tad bitter. To us, we think the Starbucks dark roast is better tasting. Peet's has some really great coffee's so not sure why Amazon is pushing this particular coffee. We still order this via our DASH BUTTON just to have some on hand for when we run out of Starbucks.|1
1226|1226|This medium roast coffee was recommended from America's Test Kitchen and I am pleased with the flavor... very robust! I read somewhere that the medium roast gives more caffeine than the darker roast. Maybe true, maybe not. But I am very zoomed after drinking it! Cleared a day's work in an hour! Yikes! LOL|1
1227|1227|This is the BEST decaf coffee I've found. When constant migraines made me seek out an alternative to full-caffeine coffee I had a very hard time finding any decafs that didn't taste bitter and stale. This is the only decaf I have found that is not only tolerable but actually tasty! And no more daily migraines! yeay!|1
1228|1228|This stuff is great, I have bought countless bags.  I alternate between this and Peet's French Roast.  If you like dark roasts, this is definitely worth a try!|1
1229|1229|I have going through a phase of wanting to try different types of coffee so i ordered Peet's. The coffee was flavorful and i am glad i chose to give it a taste for the month. Only negative comment I have is that the 12oz i received was roasted 4 months ago and says it was the freshest a month ago on the package.|0
1230|1230|Perfect taste for us. We usually drink the Pike Place at Starbucks and these are about the same.|1
1231|1231|This is my new favorite coffee. Very dark, very robust, very smooth and very strong. Great price compared to the local grocery store. I get it on subscribe and save and look forward to having my two cups every morning!|1
1232|1232|I've been trying out water-process decaf coffees during my pregnancy, and this one and Tim Horton's are the winners.|1
1233|1233|This is my absolute FAVORITE coffee. I cannot tolerate caffeine but love the taste of coffee and cream. I tried this on a whim and fell in love. It's rich and satisfying.|1
1234|1234|I highly recommend this coffee, it is delicious and mellow. Didn't get to enjoy this bag though :( I had some issues, the coffee bag had been punctured & I got a refund. Will buy again & again :)|1
1235|1235|So pleasantly surprised by this pre-ground coffee. Normally I prefer to grind my own beans because most pre-ground coffee always comes off tasting stale and old to me but this coffee was nothing less than spectacular. The aroma upon opening the bag was so nostril seducing and the flavor was rich, full bodied and smooth.|1
1236|1236|Pretty good coffee, not my favorite but I will at least finish the whole bag! I love different kinds of coffees and try new ones all the time.Peets is a good brand and I'm sure I will buy it again, just in a different flavor.|1
1237|1237|I first tasted Peet's coffee 40 years ago and it's still one of the best coffees out there.|1
1238|1238|Great flavor. A quite bitter blend and very smooth.|1
1239|1239|As before, GREAT coffee, but near the expiration date.|1
1240|1240|This might be my new favorite! Tastes amazing!!|1
1241|1241|Not my favorite of the Peets line.|0
1242|1242|Husband loves the taste.|1
1243|1243|great coffee|1
1244|1244|Great Product|1
1245|1245|Pretty good coffee, especially for the price.|1
1246|1246|Great thanks|1
1247|1247|This is really good coffee.  Strong and smooth.|1
1248|1248|Good coffee.  I like to grind my own, so this is great.|1
1249|1249|Good coffee! No strong after taste, very smooth tasting.|1
1250|1250|this is very good taste and excellent coffee bean I strongly recommend this for others|1
1251|1251|Purchased to give as a Great Gift!|1
1252|1252|A little experimenting to got our strength rights and WOW.  Never tasted coffee this good, a wonderful aftertaste.|1
1253|1253|This is a nice tasting coffee.  My wife likes it more than the regular commercial fare.|1
1254|1254|Great dark bean amazing flavor.|1
1255|1255|This is the original Berkley University Cram Session into the early hours study juice. :)|1
1256|1256|A+++|1
1257|1257|good taste without caffeine for us with heart problems|1
1258|1258|KEEP  THOSE  MILLENNIALS  HAPPY|1
1259|1259|Best coffee I've had.|1
1260|1260|Love this flavor|1
1261|1261|Too bitter for me.  I actually don't mind it but it isn't as good as other coffees available for the same price.|0
1262|1262|Good stuff.|1
1263|1263|Tasty!|1
1264|1264|Delicious|1
1265|1265|Not my favorite but certainly a good cup of coffee.  I played with the grind a little and found that I needed slightly finer than typical to get the brew I wanted.  Flavor is good but not quite as robust as I'd like.  Overall I like Peet's coffee but prefer smaller roasters and more depth of flavor.|1
1266|1266|EXCELLENT SMOOTH COFFEE. HOWEVER, I WOULD CLASSIFY AS A DARKER THAN MEDIUM ROAST.|1
1267|1267|I usually drink medium blend coffee (Donut shop, Starbucks). I love  rich coffee flavor so much that I don't mind dark roast sometimes. This was first time tasting Peet's coffee in dark roast and I enjoyed it a lot. Will buy again.|1
1268|1268|Ordered 05/09, beans roasted 04/04 = Fresh! Nice and oily dark roast coffee beans. Brewed following instructions via pour-over and tastes amazing. Lots of body, not much acidity, with many different flavor notes. Will definitely buy again, thanks Peet!|1
1269|1269|Good coffee. I don't find it amazing, but it is good. I wouldn't be compelled to buy it repetitively but as something to try it was decent.|1
1270|1270|Hard to tell this is a decaf coffee, it is so flavorful, rich and smooth. l'll be buying again!|1
1271|1271|great tasting coffee. When I first got it I had a cup and then I did something I normally don't do.....had another right away. Very smooth|1
1272|1272|Perfect coffee!|1
1273|1273|Both my husband and I choose this coffee as our favorite but since we started using the pods that we fill ourselves, we’ve found that the coffee grounds are too fine and we find quite a bit the bottom of our cup. None of the verbiage on the Peet’s coffees says the type of grind the coffee is.|1
1274|1274|Very smooth, delicious coffee. Coffee lovers should definitely try it.|1
1275|1275|I LOVE Major Dickasons coffee but the Subscribe and Save dates are usually too close to expiration for satisfaction.  Today's delivery 11.12.18 (pic) xpired on 9.17.18. Cause for cancellation!|0
1276|1276|Coffee ordered two days ago. Coffee arrived today November 8th.  Package reads ‘Freshest by 9/09/2018’Yuck!  I will be returning this hopefully with no hassle.|0
1277|1277|Excellent coffee for leisurely mornings.|1
1278|1278|Tastes good and has no heavy or bitterness issues.|1
1279|1279|My all time favorite.  Not much to say - this is the best coffee.|1
1280|1280|I love Major Dickason’s blend but the package was received after the ‘freshest by’ date. :(|0
1281|1281|I tried the k cups and loved the flavor, so I bought the ground version to drink at home. It was TOTALLY different. The coffee tastes like soap and is literally too disgusting to drink. I'm not sure what the problem is, but something is definitely not right with the coffee I was sent.|0
1282|1282|I like Peet’s Major Dickason’s Blend coffee.  Thanks, Amazon Prime, for making Peet’s coffees available to the world market!|1
1283|1283|Great product|1
1284|1284|A few years ago I saw a Country Cooking show and they review different products-one was Coffee--and each was tested-and he winner was Peet's Columbian I went right out and bought it---and yes it's a winner.|1
1285|1285|Really like this coffee unfortunately it's cheaper in the store|1
1286|1286|This is the best coffee on the market! I especially love there's no bitter taste-just a delicious rich flavor. It even smells better than other coffee for which I have no explanation.|1
1287|1287|Best big brand coffee I've had so far for espresso.|1
1288|1288|This product EXPIRED ONE YEAR AGO!!!!|0
1289|1289|"This ""medium"" roast is over roasted. Dark brown with a bit of oil on the surface of the beans. Purchased Oct 17, 2018, it has an Aug 14 roast date but doesn't smell very fresh. In fact, it doesn't smell like much of anything even after grinding. Can't taste much other than bitter due to the over roasting. Will not be buying this again."|0
1290|1290|I wish Amazon would allow different categories for leaving stars.For example, in this case, the coffee is delicious and is quickly becoming our favorite.However, this being only our second order I am surprised the bag we received was roasted on 7/12 and is freshest by 10/10.  We received it October 4th!I am sadly sending this back and worry, as other reviewers have, about freshness and the product's quality.|0
1291|1291|Worst coffee I’ve ever tasted!  It didn’t even smell like coffee...smelled like burnt popcorn.  Dumped it after 2 sips, gross.|0
1292|1292|good product|1
1293|1293|This is our go to for the daily morning coffee in the drip coffee maker. Bold, flavorful, and smooth. Perfectly dark roasted without getting the burnt taste of, say, a typical French Roast.Still good as an espresso, but there are better options from Peet’s (Espresso Forte) and elsewhere.|1
1294|1294|Pretty Tasty. Have somewhat bold taste.|1
1295|1295|Coffee arrived punctured? Coffee spilled throughout the package.  Please advise!|0
1296|1296|Tastes great!|1
1297|1297|Do this with subscribe and save which is great, just wish the prices would stay stable.  Most times the subsequent orders for subscribe and save go up at least 10% even after the discount so make sure to watch every month!|1
1298|1298|"The coffee is great, but Amazon delivered it to me less than ten days before the ""best by"" date."|0
1299|1299|Best Coffee.|1
1300|1300|This is one of the betterbold roast coffee's!.|1
1301|1301|Bought to make run for steak.  Smells yummy|1
