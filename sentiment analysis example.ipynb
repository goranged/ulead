So you end up too often roasting a batch of beans at 6 am so you can have a morning cup. Which means you\\'re grinding and perking warm beans which is not optimal.So too much of a hassle and while I still do the occasional batch to my own particular taste, I have shopped around for a reliable substitute.The first thing I discovered is that you can pay a lot of money for some really mediocre to lousy beans. But I eventually managed tofind some primo stuff and this is one I highly recommend.I\\'m not going to give you all that \"floral notes and finish of absinthe\" nonsense.  It\\'s just good coffee, dark and rich and never bitter. These guys do a good job and you ought to give it a try. Maybe you\\'ll like it and maybe it won\\'t be exactly what you\\'re looking for but either way you won\\'t feel like you paid a premium price for a bag of mud,',\n",

Keep in mind that even the book about the history of Starbucks has a mention of how they wanted to model their product after Peet\\'s... and Peet\\'s just cares so much about flavor, roasting, complexity, etc., etc. that you can\\'t go wrong.  You might say \"welllllll, my local coffee house does an amazing job\", but you know what, most local coffee roasters still don\\'t have the expertise or the equipment, or the scientists and artists behind Peet\\'s coffee... even Starbucks supposedly over-roasts their beans for consistency, and Starbucks is a little too speedy and anxiety causing for me.  Peet\\'s is to Coffee what a great vintner is to wine... they\\'re true connoisseurs.  Enjoy!  Also, as a suggestion, just keep shopping and shopping and shopping and eventually you\\'ll see some great deals on here...',\n",

       " [\"This is a good, strong coffee. It's not the original Major Dickason's Blend that put Peet's on the map in the late 1980's though. Back then the beans were quite rich and a real treat. As with any coffee bean over the years, crops change, so beans are not quite the same. I have found this to be true when ordering any of my favorites directly from Peet's over the past few years or via Amazon.I wouldn't call the newest incarnation of this blend bitter, but it is a tiny bit acidic. To balance the acidity, I usually put 2 scoops of Peet's French Roast in for a fuller body and smoothness. For me. that's the perfect cup as I love full-bodied, strong, but low acidity coffees that have a richness to them.I have read the reviews about receiving a stale bag after receiving one for the first time last week (use by date was only 6 days away and roast date was in the Fall of 2017). I would advise anyone going through Prime to just chat with them about this instead of negative comments. They have wonderful customer service reps who will take care of the matter. It would be a shame if this is the first time you tried the Major Dickason's Blend and didn't enjoy a fresh, robust cup. While not my favorite Peet's blend due to the acidity of late, it's still really good compared to other bagged coffees. If you like a weaker cup, just reduce by one scoop. It doesn't get watery, just a bit less in your face.\",\n",

       " ['At times, making a good espresso seems to be a fleeting event. I do find with Peet’s Major Dickason’s whole coffee beans, my results are more reliable and consistent.While I drink several other beans and constantly try others, Peet\\'s Major Dickason\\'s Whole Beans are my go to coffee several days a week.I am a dedicated espresso drinker, but it has taken me years to make a good espresso at home. Saying \"good\" however, is a matter of opinion. I have had good espressos at some cafes and restaurants, but most of the time, I am disappointed, and yet these places have loyal customers, who buy the same espresso and enjoy it. For me a good espresso is dependent on three things:1. The quality of the beans2. The equipment3. The techniqueStarting with a simple screw on cover espresso machine, I have upgraded a couple of times over twenty years. I started with the standard Krups electric spice and bean grinder and while the grind was not consistent, I did not know anything else. I still have that grinder, and now, I only use it for spices.For me, a burr grinder was a turning point, but I never thought I would own one. After reading a couple Kindle e-books and scouring the web, I became obsessed with improving my technique, and to my surprise, my wife gave me a Rancillio burr grinder. (Great wife!).Along the way, I discovered Peet’s Major Dickason’s whole beans and then found it on Amazon for a great price, with Prime Shipping. It has become a solid performer for me, and while I go through periods of success and failure with any beans, Peet’s Major Dickason\\'s whole beans are consistent. They give me a smooth cup, when I make it right. I have used many other beans, and have a few other favorites, but Peet’s Major Dickason’s is my day-to-day go to coffee.I made the mistake of ordering the ground coffee (vs. whole beans) a month ago, and could not use it for espresso. I tried using it in my Moka Pot, but the grind was too coarse. I immediately ordered the whole beans, because the price is typically as good I can find it locally, and as a Prime member, I get the beans in two days. Why go to the store, when I can have them quickly delivered to my home?My other performers are Bella Finca (Henry’s House of Coffee, San Francisco) and one of Atomic Coffee Roasters espresso (Beverly, MA). Atomic has two different espresso beans, but I cannot recall the one I like better. Both are sold by GoCoffeeGo on Amazon. GoCoffeeGo has a $5 shipping charge, so those coffees are too expensive for my normal budget. I have enjoyed the Kicking Horse coffees on Amazon: Kick Ass, Grizzly Claw and their 454 Horse Power, in that order. I find, as mentioned by other reviewers, that Kick Ass beans are inconsistent, which is very disappointing. Recently it doesn’t even taste like the same coffee I have had from them for the past eight months, otherwise, I would drink more of it.As to technique, my preference is to keep my beans in a steel vacuumed coffee canister on the counter, measuring out 15.6 grahams of beans, a fine ground (it’s all relative, I grind it to get my targeted pour time and taste), a firm five-point tamping method, preheated cup and saucer, and 25 +/- second pour. I strive for a dark honey colored stream, with plenty of crèma, which I read is the “Holy Grail” of the espresso world. The delectable brew is captured in a little measuring marked shot glass. I do a lot of praying during these moments, I talk nicely to all my equipment and cheer them on. When everything lines up, the result is a perfect cup for me. There are days where I must walk away from my attempts. At times, making a good espresso seems to be a fleeting event. I do find with Peet’s Major Dickason’s whole coffee beans, my results are more reliable and in my world, a good smooth doppio (2 ounces) with a nice crèma, is a wonderful thing.',\n",

But when I discovered Maj D I was surprised at how rich, complex and satisfying of a roast it was.  For a while I ordered from their website but I'd check in with amazon from time to time and saw they had this listing while shopping one day.  Gave it a shot as I'm always a bit cautious about ordering whole beans off of Amazon when its Prime but knowing what the roast to order tasted like I had a good foundation for comparison.  I can happily say its the same and at the price listing (I have no trouble hitting that $25 minimum) its a solid win.  I often shop around trying other roasters/blends, but Peet's is my roaster of choice, they really are for my tastes, the best.\",\n",

I constantly have Major Dickason\\'s k-cups around for when I\\'m pressed for time and I just HAVE to have a cup of coffee.

Only a few years into making your own grinds, not a particularly experienced palate, and with some health needs when it comes to purchasing coffee.I\\'m a weird duck. Everyone from doctors to researchers to popular coffee websites all seem to advocate that darker roasts are the way to go if you\\'re an acid sufferer. But dark roasts have always, always made me sick. For days after drinking them - regardless of brand - I have horrible acid. For that reason, I\\'ve also come to personally dislike the intense smokiness that many darker roasts have. Lighter roasts, for whatever reason, contrary to the prevailing wisdom, don\\'t affect me in the slightest. Maybe I have weird gut pH? Go figure lol. But I\\'m very pleased to say this coffee doesn\\'t affect my stomach at all.I\\'ve been searching for a coffee, starting with medium roasts (and will soon work my way up towards very light roasts, and see how that goes) that is flavorful and aromatic in a way that isn\\'t smoky or \"roasty,\" but that is palpable and which doesn\\'t hurt my stomach. And so far, this blend is a pretty good match for what I\\'m looking for.It\\'s very mellow. It\\'s also, despite my lack of experience, what I would say I think of when I envision a \"true\" medium roast. None of the beans are over-roasted. So many \"medium\" roasts can smell and taste like dark roasts to me, sometimes being even darker and \"roastier\" than other roasts labeled as dark! Not so here. Very, very mild, unless you extract for longer than 4 minutes. (I use a french press.) And even then, up to 6 minutes (yes I know you\\'re not supposed to extract longer than 4 - I\\'m just explaining how mild it is), it only becomes very moderately more \"roasty.\"And darned if it doesn\\'t faintly smell of blueberries as claimed, due to the Ethiopian Super Natural inclusion in this blend. It\\'s not as present as a blend centered completely around that hint, but it\\'s there, faintly but pleasingly. At 4 minutes extraction, with non-boiled but just beginning to steam water (yes I know I should be more precise thermally) it tastes like what most people would probably call \"normal coffee.\" Mellow, mild, but with that great blueberry, earthy aroma. At 5 minutes it\\'s definitely stronger and more flavorful, but still very mild. At 6 minutes, it\\'s JUST beginning to taste \"roasty\" and a little more smoky, but still not very better imo.If you love really dark roasted tasting coffee, this is not the blend for you. But if you just want a nice, smooth, mellow coffee, that also has decent body and a pleasing aroma (especially at longer extractions,) you might really enjoy this. The aftertaste is very mildly citrus, and doesn\\'t \"tingle\" as much as other blends I\\'ve tried. I\\'m going to try some others, as I said moving up the roast lightness scale, but if none of them sit well with me, I could easily drink this as my daily coffee. No real downsides, not the most flavorful ever but definitely has presence and smells wonderful - although the aroma is as gentle and mellow as the flavor. I guess this is what people call \"balanced\" in the coffee world. If it is, I like it.Oh, and it has a bit less caffeine kick than some others I\\'ve tried. Which is either a good thing or not depending on what you want lol. Keep that in mind. Hope this helps someone out there with needs similar to mine.',\n",

Ever since I\\'ve been on a quest for checking out coffees, teas, k-cups vs Eko-Brew, chai mixes, etc. Whenever I obsess on a research project, I never quite end up where I thought I was going. K-Cups are \"nifty.\" However, they ARE expensive and a huge impact on waste disposal. So, after testing out the make-your-own device that came with the machine, I also bought a couple of Eko-Brews (vastly prefer them). Since I\\'m supposed to limit my caffeine intake and this machine has tripled my consumption (it\\'s still a toy,) I started testing out Decaf coffees. I really liked the San Francisco Bay Coffee Company\\'s French Roast Decaf K-cups; however, they are STILL K-cups, even if much less expensive than Keurig brand-name/licensed products.So, based on others reviews, I\\'ve been testing out various offerings of 12-oz bags of French Roast Decaf. Peet\\'s is definitely the winner so far; however, it IS more expensive. I will have to weigh the cost vs some perhaps minor differences that gives it favorite status over damned good! Without indulging in precise math, I calculate the average 8 oz cup of Peet\\'s Joe as being around 25 cents when compared to K-cup per unit costs. Meanwhile the quest goes on. But for those who can detect subtle nuances and cost isn\\'t all that big of a factor, I\\'d highly recommend trying very bold Decaf.',\n",
